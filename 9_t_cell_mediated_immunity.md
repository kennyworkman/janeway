# T Cell Mediated Immunity

Primary lymphoid tissues - bone marrow + thymus.
Secondary lymphoid tissues - lymph nodes, spleen, tonsils, mucous membranes (bowels/intenstine)

Naive T cells circulate between blood and lymphatic tissue

CD4 Effector Subsets
TH_1, TH_2, TH_17, TH_FH
T_reg

*Priming* (to distinguish from productive response)
- recognition of MHC:peptide
- binding to costims
- stimulation by cytokines to lead down particular effector path

### Descriptions of Lymphoid Tissues

*Spleen*

*Lymph Nodes*

- connected to both blood and lymphatic system
- enter from blood in *HEVs* (High Endothelial Venules)

*Mucosa Associated Lymphoid Tissue* (MALT)

### The Development of Secondary Lymphoid Tissues is controlled by TNF proteins + Lymphoid Tissue Inducer Cells

### Chemokines direct T and B cells into their respective compartments

CCL21, CCL19
CCL7, receptor expressed by T cells (and dendritic cells), responds to ^

### Naive T Cells Migrate thorugh Secondary Lymphoid Tissue

Clonally expand + differentiate into effector and memory cells with antigen
specificity.

### Entry of Lymphocytes into Lymphoid tissues requires concerted interaction of chemokines + integrins

1. Rolling
2. Activation
3. Adhesion
4. Diapedesis (enter)

### Activation of integrins by chemokines is responsible for the entry of lymphocytes into lymphoid tissue

Properties of integrins:

- Composed of alpha and beta chain
- Subfamilies are defined
- Bind tightly to ligands after receiving signals that cause changes in their conformation

T-cell integrin or *LFA-1* (Leukocyte Family Antigen 1).
Binds to ICAM-[1-3].

CCL21 (the same that direct them to the correct compartment) causes integrins
(like LFA-1 to change conformation). Once bound to ICAM, the lymphocyte
migrates into the lymphoid tissue.

### T-cell responses are initiated in the secondary lymphoid organs by activated dendritic cells

Dendritic cells can be activated by:

- TLRs or other pathogen recognition receptors
- Tissue damage
- Cytokines from infllamation

Activated DCs migrate to the lymph and express costims + antigens needed for
TCR binding.

Macrophages + B cells also present antigens. Distribution in tissue differs.
Type of interaction with T cell also differs:

- DCs initiate first response for clonal expansion + differentiation
- B cells + macophages mostly present soluble antigens + intracellular pathogen
antigens. Recruit primed CD4 T cells.

### Dendritic cells process antigens from a wide array of pathogens

Dendritic cells originate from myeloid progenitors in bone marrow. There are
two types:

- conventional
- plasmacytoid

- Are abundant in barrier tissue sites

- complement receptors
- Fc receptors
- C-type lectins
- general uptake of fluid with macropinocytosis


- Phagocytosis (II)
- Macropinocytosis (II)
- Virus (I)
- Cross presentation from phago/macropino (I)
- Sharing (eg. Herpes Simplex) (II)

### Microbe induced TLR signaling induces migration to lymphoid tissues + kicks off antigen processing

Activation is also called **licensing**

Different receptors provide maturation signals:
- TLRs 
- dual effector function of phagocytosis receptors 
- lectin

Then produces CLL7, so it will migrate to CCL21/CCL19 producing cells in
secondary lymphoid tissues

Once in there
- High levels of MHC1/MHC2
- Co-stim CD80 / CD86
- Cease ability to perform phagocytosis or macropinocytosis

The activation of co-stims is believed to distinguish self-protein presentation
from pathogen-protein presentation. The former does not activate costims.
Molecules that do are called *adjuvant*.

### Plasmacytoid DCs help T-cells but aren't relaly invo

Help conventional dendritic cells produce IL-12, which is needed by CD4 T-cells
for production of IF-\gamma.

###

B cells and macrophages seem to use antigen presentation to enhance *their* own
responses
- surface immunoglobulin with antigen <> primed CD4 T-cell -> antibody
secreting B cell
- 


Macrophage production of MHC I/II + B7 seems to be far more for maintainence +
functioniong of effector / memory T cells than any priming. Induced by
recognition of MAMP

Main function in lymph tissues is actually ingestion of stray pathogens /
apoptotic lymphocytes to keep them from entering the blood.
