## Development of B Lymphocytes

### Lymphocytes 

HSC

There is a (somewhat continuous) lineage of differentiation.

HSC -> MPP -> CLP -> pro B-cell

MPP - Multi Potent Progenitor,  (myeloid + lymphoid only)
CLP - Common Lymphoid Progenitor, committed to NK / T / B

Bone marrow stromal cells secrete key cytokines and present ligands necessary
to differentiate HSCs into B cells (FLT3). The stromal cells actually remain in
contact with developing B cells for much of the lifecycle.

#### Lymphocytes derive from HSC in the bone marrow

#### B-cell development begins with heavy chanin rearrangement 

#### pre-B-cell receptor tests for production of a complete heavy chain 

signals transition from pro B-cell to pre B-cell

#### pre-B-cell receptor signaling further inhibits heavy chain recombination

is responsible for allelic exclusion

#### Pre B-cells rearrange the light chain and express surface immunoglobulin

#### Immature B-cells are tested for autoreactivity before they leave the bone marrow

#### Lymphocytes that encounter self antigens in the periphery are eliminated / inactivated

#### Immature B-cells arriving in the spleen often die and require positive signals for maturation / long term survival

Become follicular B-cells + marginal B-cells

### Development of T Lymphocytes

#### T-cell progenitors originate in bone marrow but all important development events occur in the thymus

#### Commitment to the T-cell lineage occurs in the thymus following Notch signaling

Major transcription factors from Notch signaling:

TCF1 / GATA3 -> CD3 + Rag3

#### T-cell precursors proliferate extensively in the thymus but most die there

#### Successive stages in thymocyte development are marked by changes in surface molecules

#### Thymocytes at distinct developmental stages are found in different parts of the thymus

#### Alpha/beta and gamma/delta T cells arise from a common progenitor

#### Successful synthesis of beta chain allows the production of a pre-TCR that triggers cell proliferation + blocks further beta chain rearrangement

#### T-cells undergo successive alpha chain rearrangement until positive selection or cell death

### Positive and Negative Selection of T cells

Prior to alpha/beta receptor expression, development is independent of
peptide:MHC interaction.

#### Only thymocytes whose receptors interact with self peptide:MHC complexes survive

#### Positive selection coordinates expression of CD4 or CD8 with the specificity of the receptor

#### Thymic cortical epithelial cells mediate positive selection of developing thymocytes

#### T cells that react strongly with self antigens are deleted in the thymus

#### The strength of the signals for positive and negative selection must
differ
