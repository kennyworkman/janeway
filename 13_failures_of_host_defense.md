# Failures of Host Defense Mechanisms

##  Severe Combined Immunodeficiencies

Mutation in IL2RG gene on X chromosome (common gamma chain, \gamma_c) causes
*SCID*:

- T-cells unable to develop
- B-cells are able to develop but are unable to function without T-cells

Variants:

- somewhat ablated RAG1/RAG2 lead to *Omenn's syndrome*. Limited T-cell
repertoire somehow becomes very autoreactive leading to symptoms resembling
graft vs. host disease. (called _hypermorphic mutation_)

- "radiation sensitive" SCID is when defects in DNA repair proteins (eg.
Artemis) cause reduced somatic hypermutation that also increase susceptibility
to radiation / general DNA damage

### SCID can be caused by pathologies in the purine salvage pathways

- ADA (adenosine deaminase)
- PNP (purine nucleotide phosphorylase)

Purines - pyrimidine fused to imidazole
Defficiency in purine salvage lead to accumulation of toxic purines and kill
lymphocytes.

What does purine salvage do? Purine bases are used all over the place, not just
in DNA:

- metabolism (cyclic AMP, ATP, cofactor for NADP, CoA)
- cell signaling (GTP used in G-protein signaling, 
- protein synthesis (tRNA loading)

### T-cell based SCID (development)

- "Nude" mice/people lack proper thymus epithelial formation (FOXN1).
- DiGeorge syndrome caused by large deletion of chrom 22 leading to similar
thymic underdevelopment
- MHC-II deficiency is caused by at least 4 upstream regulatory genes
- MHC-I deficiency is generally caused by dysfunctional peptide transport proteins
(TAP1/TAP2) but otherwise normal levels of mRNA + surface MHC-I. People with
this are generally healthy indicating alternative ways of displaying peptide
- Dysfunction in thymal epithelial peptide presentation (AIRES) leads to
autoimmunity

### B-cell based SCID (development)

- Characterized by inability to fight bacteria with polysaccharide membrane
components that need opsonization
- Ogden Bruton (1957) characterized X-linked absence of antibodies
- Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) is essential in pre-BCR signaling. It is one
of the downstream proteins when the heavy and nascent/decoy light chain
assemble needed to show that it functions 
- *XLA* X-linked agammaglobulinemia

- Women randomly deactivate one chromosome early in embryonic development,
creating mosaic patchworks of cells. In *XLA*, only the B cells that receive
the functional copy develop

Other components can be dysfunctional in rarer versions of XLA, in order or
frequency:
1/ Igu
2/ lambda light chain
3/ Ig\alpha/Ig\beta (heterodimer with ITAMs necessary for internal signaling of
BCR)
4/


### T-cell / B-cell activation based defficiencies

Defects in class switching - *hyper-IgM syndrome*

On set grouped together by pathologies of CD40L - CD40 pathway:

- Most common is CD40L (on activated T-cells), necessary for eg. AID via
CD40
- CD40L defficiencies also prevent crosstalk with macrophages / dendritic
cells, dampening ILC1 response
- truly "combined" susceptability to pyogenic bacteria and intracellular bacteria

CD40 itself
NEMO

Severe *Variable* ID are characterized by late onset, smaller issues usually
with just a single isotype and scoped to B-cell:

- Mutations with TACI (interacts with APRIL and BAFF produced by T cells)
- Mutations with ICOS (present on activated T cells and necessary for B cell) 
- Hyper IgE production (**Jobs syndrom**) - STAT3 dysfunction, leading to
reduced ICL3 module. Lack of T_H17 cells might prevent inhibition of T_H2 and
too much IgE

### Immune Module Cytokine Defficiencies

- IL-12 + IFN-\gamma receptor mutation -> susceptibility to Salmonella,
Mycobateria, Listeria

- IL-17F / IL-17RA mutation -> susceptibility to _Staphylococcus aureusa_ and
_Candida albicans_

### Malfunctions with cytolytic pathway

Shows the complexity and number of moving pieces with effective release of eg.
perforin:

1/ Acivation
2/ Polarization (movement of endosome to membrane)
3/ Docking
4/ Priming (making content of membrane "fusion competent")
5/ Fusion (of endosome with membrane)

Defects with intracellular trafficking:

- *Chediak-Higashi syndrome*
- *Griscelli syndrome*

Also cause issues with melanocytes (skin pigment) and vision (eye pigment) in
many cases. Many

The lack of active immunity stimulates macrophages.  Macrophages cause so much
inflammation that they start eating blood cells

*hemophagocytic lymphohemocytosis*

### Failure to curb EBV

- Epstein-Barr Virus infects 95% of people
- Usually reduced to a latent state within B-cells by healthy NK / T / NKT response
- *XLP* (*X-linked lymphoproliferative*) causes expansion of EPV infected B/T
  cells + lack of antibodies

T-cell <> antigen presenting cell
NK-cell <> target cell
*SLAM* mediates interaction
dysfunctional SAP prevents SLAM

### Dendritic cells

T cells suffer

The two population validated genetic targets are:

### GATA2

Kind of unclear but probably involved in maintaining stem cell progenitors.

Has two forms: 

- autosomal recessive (two bad copies)
- autosomal dominant negative (one bad copy)

### IRF8

Specific defect with dendritic cells rather than progenitor. DNA binding
transcription factor.

### Complement

### Recall pathways

- Classic
- Mannose binding lectin
- Alternative (constant, low-rate "tick over" that provides blood surveillance)

All converge to C3 cleavage and membrane attack components C5-9.

### Different complement disease

*C3* - increased susceptibility to pyogenic bacteria

*Membrane attack proteins* (C5-C9) result almost exclusively in susceptibility
  to Neisseria
- Japan population - 1 / 2e6 -> 1/200 risk when these proteins are mutated

*classic complement* - more _immune complexes_ (eg. clumps of matter in kidney? SLE)

*MBL* - (common, ~5% of population) more risk of bacterial infection

*control proteins* - complement covers self cells, eg. blood cells in
paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria

### Phagocytic cells

These are generally bad. Four major types:

1/ Development
2/ Adhesion
3/ Activation
4/ Killing

#### Development

- Severe Congenital Neutropenia (SCN)
- Cyclic Neutropenia

With SCN, 3-5 * 10^9 per liter to like 0.5 * 10^9

ELA2/*neutrophil elastase*. 
- Mostly caused by defects in the "primary" granules (azurophilic granules,
stained blue with Romanowsky/ methylene blue stains)
- autosomal dominant mutation causes one form of SCN

- Still don't undertand what causes the cycles (~21 day, 3 week periods?) in the
cyclic flavor.

Variety of autosomal recessive variants
- Kostmann's disease

Can also gain neutropenia with therapies - eg. chemo, cancer, aplastic anemia
(condition of bone marrow that cause defficiency in immune cell production)
OR part of other combined ID.

#### Adhesion

The migration to infection is a multi step process and any damaging any
component can lead to problems

Rolling -> Firm adhesion -> activation and "lock" of integrin

LAD2 -> LAD1 -> LAD3

1/ glycosylated ligands needed for selectin mediated rolling
2/ missing piece of \beta integrin (CD18)
3/ induction of high affinity state of \beta integrin

#### Activation

TLRs play central role. High amount of redundancy and remarkably only defects
with TLR3 actually cause problems. Susceptibility to HSV and can cause brain
swelling (encephalitis).

Also other PRR (pattern recognizing receptors)

#### Killing / Ingestion

Defects in the ROS. Result in *chronic granulomatous disease*.

Actually showed that oxides themselve are insufficeint to kill but create a low
pH environment that allow true microbicidal peptides to kill.

### Regulators of inflammation

*Pyrin*:

- apoptosis of inflammatory cells
- inhibit secretion of IL-1\beta

*Inflammasome*:

Functions:
- releases inflammatory cytokines, by processing eg. pro IL-1\beta into active form
- causes programmed cell death, via cleaved caspase

Structure:
- NLRP3 is a "sensor" protein
- forms a pinwheel structure

Diseases:

- *Familial Mediterranean Fever* - lack of pyrin. 
- *pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum and acne* (PAPA) - another lack of pyrin
- *TNF-receptor associated periodic syndrome* - lack of TNF receptor, high TNF-\alpha. Treated by TNF blockers, like those developed for RA.
- *Muckle-Wells* / *familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome* (FCAS) - defects in NLRP3, causing inflammasome to be "on" more than it should


### HSC transplantation

You can get autoimmunity in two broad directions, mostly caused by MHC
mismatches:

- graft vs host: when immune cells from transplant attack host
- host vs graft: where immune cells in the graft attack transplant

Depletion by chemotherapy is common, but the extent or use of cytotoxic pre
treatment depends on the disease. Some diseases require complete elimination of
immune cells because they were already dysfunctional.

(like XLA, the B-cell abnormality that leads to HSV)

Somatic gene therapy began by the use of retroviruses to insert corrections.
However, strong enhancers in genetic cargo misinserted upstream  of
proto-oncogenes, causing leukemia.

Broad corrections:

- ex-vivo editing, driven by iPSC reprogramming to make new HSC
- expression systems that can be shut down

## How different pathogens evade immune system

- HIV. virus
- tuberculosis (Mycobacterium). bacteria.
- malaria (Plasmodium falciparum). protozoa

### Extracellular evasion strategies

Gram negative. LPS. TLR-4.
Gram positive. Peptidoglycan. TLR-2 + NOD1/NOD2.

Outside:

- Modifications to LPS lipid-A base/core. TLR-4 antagonism instead of agonism.
- Modulation of peptidoglycan.
- Carbohydrate shell to both evade TLR-2 and opsinisation/phagocytosis.
- Significant carb variation on eg. Streptococcus
- DNA rearrangement on E coli, Neiserria leading to carb / pillus variation

Misc.:

- Blocking C3 cleavage
- *Protein A*. Fc-binding proteins that interfere with antibodies
- *Factor H*. Prevent complement binding. Decorated on bacterial surfaces.

### Intracellular evasion strategies

- Prevention of phagolysosome formation
- Escape phagosome
- Resistance to microbicidal compounds

- Listeria escape into cytosol. Hijack actin push membrane bound packets to
other cells.
- Salmonellaa release factors to prevent destruction of their vacuole
- Tuberculosis prevents fusion with phagosome

Two types of lepropsy, with different response types:

- Tuberculoid lepropsy
- Lepromatous lepropsy

### Protozoans

Theme here is _evasion_

- Trypanosoma brucei constantly cycle the glycoprotein they express allowing
variants to survive under selection of antibody. Cycles of antigen clearance
eventually lead to coma ("sleeping sickness")
- Plasmodium moves from the liver to the blood cells, creating moving target
for disease
- Leishmania major prevents release of IL-12 by macrophage host, suppressing NK
activation + T_H1 differentiation in type-1 response

### RNA virus

- plasmacytoid DCs + NK cells before T_H1 + CD8 T cells are ready
- RNA polymerases have higher error rate -> viral chromosome is smaller
- RNA chrom also tend to be segmented
- *antigenic drift* - mutation of epitope
- *antigenic shift* - exchange of segmented 

Influenza - 
Hepatitis C virus (HCV), leading cause of liver cirrhosis
- CD81 binding glycosylated protein that is difficult to bind to

### DNA virus

- Lower mutation rates -> larger genomes -> more machinery to evade/subvert
- Many enter latency allowing them to escape recognition for long periods with
cyclic reactivation

9/10 people are infected by the 5 common types of herpesvirus:

- HSV-1 (mouth)
- HSV-2 (genitals)
- EBV (mononucleosis / "mono")
- varicella-zoster
- cytomegalovirus (CMV)

#### Evasion Mechanisms

*immunoevasins* are class of proteins preventing peptide display
- Disrupting various steps of loading and presenting antigens (redirect to
degradation in the ER)
1/ TAP transport/peptide entry to ER 
2/ movement of MHC to cell surface 
3/ _dislocation_ (degradation of MHC)

Inhibiting cytolysis by NK cells normally caused by lack of MHC expression with
decoy MHCs.

Cytokine disruption:

- Decoy receptors
- Receptor inhibitors
- JAK/STAT inhibition
- expression inhibition
- cyotkine induced TF inhibition
- direct antagonism of cytokine itself
- decoy cytokines, eg. cmvIL-10

Chemokine disruption:

- Decoy receptors (herpesvirus + poxvirus display >40 homologs)

CMV / HCV shown to increase PDL1.

Recall cheomkine receptors are exclusively GPCR (7 transmembrane spanning).
While cytokine receptors are single transmembrane protein (also associated with
STAT).

## AIDS

Zoonotic infection with at least four crossover events, two of which were in
the early 1900s, likely from lowland gorillas or chimpanzees.

HIV-1/HIV-2

### Structure

*3 major genes*

_gag_

_pol_ (alone encodes replication tools)
- reverse transcriptase
- integrase
- viral protease

_env_
gp120 + gp41 (trimers alongside the envelope)

*6 regulatory genes*
Tat + Rev are essential for early replication
Nef Vif Vpr Vpu are necessary for efficient viral production

What determines if it enters latent or actively replicating state?
Maybe determined by the state of the infected cell itself

CD4 cells are long lived in contrast to macro + DCs. Difference in state there
provide clues for quiescence

### Replication mechanics

*NFkB* + *NFAT* both used to induce expression of proviral genes (nuclear factor of activated T cells)
Recall:
- NFkB is common across most immune cell types
- NFAT is specific to T cells and primarily induced by direct TCR stimulation

(Bind directly to the promoters in the proviral LTR - these are functional!, not
just scars for integrase recognition)

*Tat* and *Rev* reveal important eurkaryotic replication components:
- Tat phosphorylates RNA polymerase (in combination with cyclin T1 + CDK9), to
enable the enzyme to produce full length transcripts
- Rev is necessary to shuttle unspliced mRNA for later viral components out of
the nucleus. It binds to motifs on later unspliced transcripts and recruits 

The smaller regulatory genes:

- decrease expression of surface proteins like MHC I/II, allowing invasion
- prevent cytidine deaminase (APOBEC) from mutating transcript

### Where in the body replication happens

Usually in sex fluid or blood. Free virus or within one of the cells listed.

*genital + gastrointenstainal mucosae* are primary sites of sexual transmission
- initial contact with memory T cells + DCs
- spread to lymph
- from the lymph the entire bloodstream

### Tropism

Variants have affinity for *CCR5* or *CXCR5*. (a la R5 or X4).

Needs to get to the CD4 immune cells in the lamina propria.
So *transcytosis* through epithelial cells + traveling through
"interdigitating" DCs.

- gp120 binds to proteins on both squamous and columnar epithelia
    - squamous -> vagina mucous, penis foreskin, ectocervix, rectum, oropharynx,
    esophagous
    - columnar -> endocervix, rectum, upper GI
- DC receptors:
- langerin (CD207)
- mannose receptor (CD206)
- DC-SIGN


1/ acute phase (influenza like illness
- rapid replication of virus in mostly CCR5+ CD4+ T cells
- population quickly declines
- immune cell depletion in GALT leads to further infection (in particular IL-17
+ IL-22 no longer around to promote tight epithelia)
2/ asymptomatic phase (~10 years)
- seroconversion (first point antibodies detected)
- 

### Genetic resistance

Non function variant of CCR5 in Caucasians confers some resistance (not cure
but decreases rate of progress) and suggests some past selection. Some suggest
small pox and bubonic plauge provided selection.

### Development of AIDS

After the initial depletion, T cells recover. But after the variable period,
they start to decline again:

- CD8 T cells kill virus infected T cells
- latent virus awakening + killing T cells
- disruption of new T cell development in thymus

Immune activity does help. 
Type 1 response (IFN-\gamma + granzyme B) inversely correlated with viral
presence in blood ("viral load"). The irony is these are the very cells the
virus kills off slowly...

Anti-retrovirals are somewhat effective

Neutralizing antibodies do develop but generally later (after first year). Vaccines
therefore might be promising

ADCC mediated (non-neutralizing) antibodies also recruit NK, macrophage,
neutrophils.

Virus mutates a lot, making antibody mediated response challenging

### Reservoir in lymph tissues

- Within CD4 T cell, macrophage, neutrophil (latter are shorter lived and not
major holders)
- Immune complexes actully form on the _surface_ of follicular DCs in lymph

### Genetic resistance

Some people (1 / 300) live with latent virus and never progress to AIDS.
Strongest loci are HLA traits, presumably enhancing presentation of virus and
preventing their silent latent state.

### What kinds of diseases

- Candida (oral fungal infection)
- tuberculosis

Cancers:
- EBV induced lymphomas
- Kaposi sarcoma (induced by HIV)

In both cancers, the viruses don't actually introduce mutation but induce
survival that select for oncogenetic mutation)

### How do we treat it?

Target:

- reverse transcriptase
- integrase
- protease (required for creating functional product)

#### *HAART* (Highly active anti-retroviral therapy)

Can prevent infection of new cells. But cannot remove integrated provirus.

Combination therapy, eg. a cocktail of different inhibitors, called HAART.
Showed success starting in 1995. Must take for life.

- Releases T cells trapped in lymph tissue
- Decreases CD4 cell killing by CD8 T cells
- Somehow new T cells emerge from thymus

Can detect these with TRECs (T cell receptor excision circles) - the little
loops that form during somatic hypermutation.

New drugs also target viral integration + cDNA creation. Do not deplete latent
reservoir

#### Targeting reservoirs

- Try to tease out virus by activating provirus. (Clincal data does not show
efficacy over HAART alone)
- Cytokines (TNF-\alpha, IL-1) or histone acetylation to active proviral genes

Berlin patient HCST to inject T cells with CCR5 mutation. Progression free for
5 years. Risk of CXCR4-tropic variant mutation. Also impractical as population
level cure.

#### Vaccines are difficult

Two types of vaccines:

- Prophylactic. What variant to you target? If you do generate antibodies, it
is hard for them to bind glycoproteins on HIV.
- Already infected. If you increase antibody + CD8 T cell response, still hard to clear
virus.

Other vaccines use broken viruses of the type they are treating.
Cannot do this with HIV because of high mutation rate + risk of recombination
Use "canary" virus - AAV, vaccinia

delivery gag,pol,env genes with canarypox vector:
- only vaccine that has any efficacy
- data shows type of response useful - non-neutralizing for ADCC. (this is good
because neutralizing kind are hard to develop)
