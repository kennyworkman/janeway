# Failures of Host Defense Mechanisms

##  Severe Combined Immunodeficiencies

Mutation in IL2RG gene on X chromosome (common gamma chain, \gamma_c) causes
*SCID*:

- T-cells unable to develop
- B-cells are able to develop but are unable to function without T-cells

Variants:

- somewhat ablated RAG1/RAG2 lead to *Omenn's syndrome*. Limited T-cell
repertoire somehow becomes very autoreactive leading to symptoms resembling
graft vs. host disease. (called _hypermorphic mutation_)

- "radiation sensitive" SCID is when defects in DNA repair proteins (eg.
Artemis) cause reduced somatic hypermutation that also increase susceptibility
to radiation / general DNA damage

### SCID can be caused by pathologies in the purine salvage pathways

- ADA (adenosine deaminase)
- PNP (purine nucleotide phosphorylase)

Purines - pyrimidine fused to imidazole
Defficiency in purine salvage lead to accumulation of toxic purines and kill
lymphocytes.

What does purine salvage do? Purine bases are used all over the place, not just
in DNA:

- metabolism (cyclic AMP, ATP, cofactor for NADP, CoA)
- cell signaling (GTP used in G-protein signaling, 
- protein synthesis (tRNA loading)

### T-cell based SCID

- "Nude" mice/people lack proper thymus epithelial formation (FOXN1).
- DiGeorge syndrome caused by large deletion of chrom 22 leading to similar
thymic underdevelopment
- MHC-II deficiency is caused by at least 4 upstream regulatory genes
- MHC-I deficiency is generally caused by dysfunctional peptide transport proteins
(TAP1/TAP2) but otherwise normal levels of mRNA + surface MHC-I. People with
this are generally healthy indicating alternative ways of displaying peptide
- Dysfunction in thymal epithelial peptide presentation (AIRES) leads to
autoimmunity

### B-cell based SCID

- Characterized by inability to fight bacteria with polysaccharide membrane
components that need opsonization
- Ogden Bruton (1957) characterized X-linked absence of antibodies
- Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) is essential in pre-BCR signaling. It is one
of the downstream proteins when the heavy and nascent/decoy light chain
assemble needed to show that it functions
