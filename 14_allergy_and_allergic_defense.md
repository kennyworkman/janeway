Allergy and Allergic Defense
===

Gell + Coombs classification system:

1. IgE (+ Mast cells)
2. Complement
3. Fc effector molecules
4. Various cellular effectors (lymphocytes + myeloid)

However, becoming more clear the 1/2/3 immune module system is a better
classifier of allergies.

Burden of allergy disease is actually sig. Lost time from school + work.

## IgE Allergies

*Immediate hypersensitivity reactions* - multivalent IgE bridging on surface of
mast + basophils.

Predisposition to IgE reaction is *atopy*

## Non-IgE Allergies

First exposure called sensitization.

- nasal passages (allergic rhinitis)
- eyes (*conjunctivitis*, refers to the conjunctiva)
- lower lungs + airways (asthma)
- gastrointestinal tract ()

Systemic reactions can spread from initial site:

- skin
- lungs (bronchospasms)
- vascular system

*atopic march* is the progression of reactions as someone ages

### Mechanisms of sensitization

1/ T_H2
2/ IgE class switching

1/ T_H2 differentiation

- DCs in mucosal tissue sample antigen and migrate to lymph tissue
- T_H2 cells induced by IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-13
- T_H2 cells produce IL-9/IL-13, positive feedback
- Mast cells + epithelial cells produce IL-33, also helping differentiation

In healthy individuals + absence of inflammation, T_regs induced by ,
controlling the response.

2/ T_H2 cause class switching:

- IL-4 or IL-13 -> Jak1/Jak3 -> STAT6
- CD40L (T cell) <> CD40 (B cell)

Mast cells also present CD40L + secret IL-4.

Dendritic cells, like Langerhan cells in skin, can "trap" antigens with nets of
surface IgE. eg. (*Fc\epsilonR1*)

### Antigens that cause sensitization

Actual numbers (small amounts):
- 1 ug of ragweed pollen allergen
- 20-75 ug bee venom

It is difficult to identify common characteristics of allergens.

Some are proteases:
*Der p 1*. Allergy in 20% of people. Cleaves occludin in epithelial junction
and access to subepithelial antigen presenting cells
*LEKT1*. (lymphoepithelial Kazal type-related inhibitor). Allergy diseases caused by mutations in protease inhibitors. *SPINK5* in *Netherton's syndrome*
- overactive _kallikrein_. Shedding of keratinocytes from cleaved desmosomes.
- overexpression of TSLP, TNF, ICAM
- LEKT1 also inhibits Staph. See colonization of skin with these bacteria in Netherton's syndrome patients

Transfer of 2S albumin from brazil nut into soybean caused allergic reaction
discontinuation of cell ag project

### Genetic predisposition

*Atopic triad*:
- allergic rhinoconjuctivitis
- allergic asthma
- allergic eczema

Asthma + eczema often linked. Although each individual allergy type has own
linked genes. Also ethnic differences.

#### Risk factors for general atopy

*11q12-13*

\beta subunit of Fc\epsilonRI

*5q31-33*

1/ IgE class switching, mast + eosinophil activation

IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-13

2/ TIM family

(T-cell, Immunoglobulin domain, Mucin domain) 
Associated with _airway hyperreacrtivity_, not only to specific allergens

Expressed by T_H1 + T_H2 cells
https://www.nature.com/articles/nri1111

3/ p40

Common subunit of IL-12 + IL-23

4/ \beta-andrenergic receptor

Smooth muscle contraction in airways

#### Risk factors for specific antigens

In contrast to above genes, which dysregulate immune response downstream of
arbitrary antigen, these are MHC allele variants for specific allergens

eg. HLA-B15:02 + peptide react to carbamazepine (seizure medication) leading to
rashes over the body that lead to scalding

#### Specific allergy disease mutations

- *fillagrin* (helps make "cornifying" keratinocytes tight) involved in eczema +
asthma. 7-10% of Caucasians have fillagrin mutation.
- metalloproteinase *ADAM33* in bronchial smooth muscle cells

### Environmental risk factors

Rural Africans show less atopy than American Africans.

*hygiene hypothesis* - exposure to pathogens early in childhood skews immune
development towards type 1 immune response from type 2.

However, negative correlation between atopy + helminth infections. Hygeine
hypothesis has evolved to include all three immune response types => trigger
*TGF-\beta + IL-10* -> 
* less differentiation of all three helper types and
* increased production T_reg 

Some pathogens help and others increase risk:

- RSV skews IFN-\gamma towards IL-4 (1->2) and increase asthma development
inkids

Diesel exhaust increases ROS, like ozone, increasing IgE production 20-50
fold
- dysfunction in genes that prevent oxidative stress (GSTP1, GSTM1) linked to
worse asthma
- inhibitors for eg. NADPH, might help asthma

### T_regs play important role

- T_regs isolated from atopic individuals when cocultured with T_H2 cells are
less effective a repressing cytokines
- Mice defficient in Foxp3 have greater risk for atopy

Treatments:

- IDO
- IL-35 / Il-27 cyotkine therapy, which inhibit T_H2

## Mechanisms

1/ IgE bound to surface
2/ Mast cells release factors:
- histamine (from granules)
- prostaglandin
- leukotriene
- PAF (platelet activating factor)
3/ Physiological effect of factors
4/ Recruitment of effector cells

### Different IgE receptors

*Immunoglobulin family Fc\epislonRI*

Mast cells + basophils
Activated with familiar tyrosine kinase -> ITAM -> Syk -> downstream effectors
Increased IgE increases surface expression

*C-type lectin family Fc\epsilonRII*

Many immune + epithelial cell types, including T + B cells.

### More on mast cells

Mast cells => IgE inflammatory responses 
(Kit knockout mice do not produce these responses)

Activated by these factors:
*stem-cell factor* / Kit ligand
IL-3
IL-4 / IL-9 (type 2)

#### Granule contents

Degranulation is an important component of function:

1/ histamine (short lived vasoactive amine)
2/ serine esterase (protease) -> tryptase, chymase, cathepsin G

- Histamine acts through 4 GPCRs.
- Histamine causes blood flow + vessel permeability. 
- Leads to edema + local inflammation.

What do the proteases do? Activate metalloproteinase that destroy venom.
Also break down tissue...

#### Types

Location and protease content 

*MC_T* -> tryptase, in mucosal epithelia (lamina propria)
*MC_CT* -> tryptase + chymase, in submucosa (deeper than the lamina propria)

#### Eicosanoids

Distinct from granule contents. These are lipid mediators synthesized from
common pathway.

AA cleaved from membrane:

- *Cyclooxygenase* -> prostaglandin, thromboxane
- *Lipooxygenase* -> leukotriene

Prostaglandin is important in asthma 
C4,D4,E4 leukotrienes sustain inflammation

#### Cytokines

TNF-\alpha - some stored and some synthesized
Recruit immune cells (and cause epithelial cells to express adhesion molecules,
helping recruitment)

IL-4 -> Type II

### Eosinophils

- <6% of cells in healthy people
- IgG, IgE, CR1 + CR3 receptors
- Two main effector functions:
- granule contents - proteases and ROS
- synthesize mediators (prostaglandin, leukotriene + cytokines)

How do they cause allergies?

- Kill T_H1 cells (IDO)G. T_H2 expansion might be in part explained by this.

- Located in submucosa

- Few are present without infection

Production and migration are distinct.

- GM-CSF + IL-5 cause _production_ in bone marrow
- _Migration_ governed by *eotaxins*: CCL11, CCL24, CCL26

Mice can have eosinophilia systemically with just lots of IL-5.

CCR3 (eotaxin receptor) is quite promiscuous and can bind to other chemokines

Basophils:
- similar growth factors
- reciprocal control by cytokines
- eosinophil *major basic protein* 

### Effects of IgE response

Synthetic introduction of antigen (intradermal antigen challenge) in lab leads
to two distinct stages:

*Immediate reaction* is characterized primarily by histamin acting on
different tissues:

Airway
- vascular permeability + blood flow => edema
- edema + smooth muscle contraction => airway narrowing

Vascular
- extravasation (leakage of fluid from blood vessel) -> edema
- reflex vasodilation (increase of blood vessel size from drug). Acts on nerve
endings, but effect is on vessels. *wheal-and-flare reaction* (wheal is swollen
bump)

*Late-stage reaction* occurs 3-9 hours. Cellular recruitment and continued
synthesis of factors

(Again primarily caused by synthetic high-dose antigen and unlikely to happen
naturally)

*Chronic allergic inflammation* is the natural long timeline allergy state

Persistent T_H2 response.

T_H2 cells release *calcitonin* + *VEGF* with effect on blood vessels.

- Can actually change size and number of cells (hypertrophy + hyperplasia of
_smoooth muscle_ cells respectively
- *airway tissue remodeling*

Think of allergic response as starting from the site where mast cells
degranulate.

### Anaphylaxis

Mast cells are often associated with blood vessels
Widespread release of eg. histamine on many vessels is *anaphylaxis*

Can also be caused by autoantibody, to IgE or Fc\epsilon, 

Symptoms:

- *Utricaria* - distributed version of wheal + flare
- *Anaphylactic shock* - lowered blood pressure + constricted airways
- Can be treated with epinephrine or \beta-adrenergic receptor modulation,
relaxing blood vessels

Penicillin and structurally related drugs can cause anaphylaxis.

Hapten - \beta-lactam ring (usually essential for antimicrobial activity) binds
to host proteins to form covalent conjuages

- T cell response from self-protein conjugates
- B cell response (from penicillin conjuages activating BCR)
- Can cross link IgE on Mast cells

### Asthma + Rhinitis?

- allergic rhinitis
- allergic conjuctivitis
- allergic asthma

All caused by mast cell degranulation in response to allergens (within) pollen.
Edema
Mucus (rich in recruited lymphocytes)

Characteristiscs of chronic inflammation:

- hypertrophy
- hyperplasia
- eventually fibrosis

Why is fibrosis a bigger deal than smooth muscle cell remodeling?

- more permanent
- does not respond to asthma medication
- progressive, positive feedback

There are different asthma endotypes (different cell types + molecules):

- common allergic asthma
- exercise induced asthma
- neutrophil predominant
- eosinophil predominant
- steroid resistant sever

How do you get which type? Allergen sensitized with + genetic factors

#### Mechanisms of common asthma

- Familiar mast thing

Epithelial cell stimulation directly by TLRs: 
- *IL-25, IL-33* (This explains where
some of the type 2 cytokines even come from)
- CCL5 / CCL11 <> CCR3 on T_H2, eosinophil, basophil
- ILCs activated and express the familiar array (4, 5, 9 , 13)

Important facts about this biology:
- TGF-\beta helps drive airway remodeling of epithelial cells
- IL-9/IL-13 leads to goblet cell metaplasia of epithelial cells (replacable
differentiation into mature cell type)
- iNKT cells (CD1d-restricted invariant) somehow are involved

You can actually get allergic disease without allergen. Shown with mice
defficient in T_H2.

Similarly chronic inflammation triggered by allergen can continue by other
factors:

- smoke, sulfur dioxide
- virus, bacterial infections of respiratory tract

Rhinovirus infection is main source of asthma hospitilizations / death

#### Food allergies

- IgE mediated
- non-IgE mediated (celiac)
- intolerance (metabolic)
- idiosyncratic (unknown)

Peanut allergies
Mast cell in gut -> fluid movement + muscle contraction
Systemic effects lead to urticaria, asthma, systemic anaphylaxis

Because allergens are generally pepsin resistant, adults who suppress this with
(eg. antacids) may have late onset allergies

## Non IgE Mediated Allergies

Type 1 and Type 3

These aren't really allergic diseases?

### Drugs covalently bind to cells

Platelets - *thrombocytopenia*
Red blood cells - *hemolytic anemia*

Cleared by Fc\gamma receptors from macrophages in the spleen.

### Immediate antibody mediated hypersensitivity

Conserved steps:

1/ Antibodies clump with antigen
2/ Complement (*C5a* + *C3a*) are activated
3/ Leukocytes w/ *Fc\gammaRIII* + CR activated; widespread tissue damage.

Soluble antigens can lead to large clumps of immune complexes:
- large clumps are cleared by monocytes (by fixing complement)
- the smaller ones get deposited on blood vessel and cause damage

*Arthus reaction*

Local immune response to spot in skin where antigen injected.

*Serum sickness*

- Originated when immunized horse serum was used to treat disease like
_Streptococcus pneumoniae_
- 7-10 days after injection for class switched IgG reaction to occur
(Normal class switching takes 3-5 days. Antigen processing + multiple discrete
antigen recognition is involved in lengthening the timeline.)
- Same steps as above, leading to mast cell degranulation

#### Serum sickness in monoclonal tx

Can result from improperly humanized monoclonals (eg. in anti-TNF-\alpha HUMIRA
for RA).

Humanization fails for patients that have strange allotypes (constant region
variations). One effect is more rapid clearance of tx and reduced effect.

- Bacterial reaction persist and continue to produce antigen
- Air pathogen exposure from dust/mold -> *farmer's lung*

### Delayed-type cell mediated hypersensitivity

T_H1 + CD8 T cells

*Mantoux test* - test for tuberculosis. Inject small amounts of tuberculin.
Elicits local type I response.

#### *allergic contact dermatitis*

Like IgE, there are two phases: 1/ sensitization and 2/ elicitation

Langerhan cells, specialized APC / DCs, mediate sensitization in cutaneous
allergies.

T_H1 response cyotkines in detail:

- IFN-\gamma: Macrophage activation + adhesion molecule expression on blood vessels
- TNF-\alpha + lymphotoxin: Local tissue destruction. Also adhesion on vessels.
- Il-3/GM-CSF: monocyte production in bone marrow

(*haptens* - small proteins that are immunogenic after being bound to carrier
proteins. Eg. penicillin or )

Poison oak causes CD8 mediated skin dermatitis with soluble proteins that pass
through membrane + present on MHCI. Comes from _urushiol oil_.

Insect bites can cause delayed-type hypersensitivity - itchy bump. (Also cause
urticaria, swelling, anaphylactic shock from immediate hypersensitivity)

Metal ions (divalent cations)

#### Examples of n-valent cations

Univalent cations: Have a charge of 1, such as the Cs+ cation
Divalent cations: Have a charge of 2, such as the Ca2+ cation
Trivalent cations: Have a charge of 3, such as the Fe3+ cation

### Celiac disease

Both allergic and autoimmune disease.

Pathology:
- Loss of finger-like villi formed by epithelial cells
- Hyperplasia of crypt cells at elbows of epithelial folds

\alpha-gliadin -> deamidation by transglutaminase (tTG) -> binds to HLA-DQ2

Autoantibodies found against tTG but don't seem to do anything.

Why don't we get oral tolerance, eg. T_regs. Not all HLA-DQ2 variant patients
develop celiac disease so not that molecule alone. 
- other unknown genetic factors (down syndrome 6x more likely)
- gliadin peptides might cause epithelial cells to release IL-15 + express
MIC-A -> NKG2D mediated CD8 T cell -> intenstinal damage + more causal CD4 T
cell activation
