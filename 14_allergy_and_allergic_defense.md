Allergy and Allergic Defense
===

Gell + Coombs classification system:

1. IgE (+ Mast cells)
2. Complement
3. Fc effector molecules
4. Various cellular effectors (lymphocytes + myeloid)

However, becoming more clear the 1/2/3 immune module system is a better
classifier of allergies.

Burden of allergy disease is actually sig. Lost time from school + work.

## IgE Allergies

*Immediate hypersensitivity reactions* - multivalent IgE bridging on surface of
mast + basophils.

Predisposition to IgE reaction is *atopy*

## Non-IgE Allergies

First exposure called sensitization.

- nasal passages (allergic rhinitis)
- eyes (*conjunctivitis*, refers to the conjunctiva)
- lower lungs + airways (asthma)
- gastrointestinal tract ()

Systemic reactions can spread from initial site:

- skin
- lungs (bronchospasms)
- vascular system

*atopic march* is the progression of reactions as someone ages

### Mechanisms of sensitization

1/ T_H2
2/ IgE class switching

1/ T_H2 differentiation

- DCs in mucosal tissue sample antigen and migrate to lymph tissue
- T_H2 cells induced by IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-13
- T_H2 cells produce IL-9/IL-13, positive feedback
- Mast cells + epithelial cells produce IL-33, also helping differentiation

In healthy individuals + absence of inflammation, T_regs induced by ,
controlling the response.

2/ T_H2 cause class switching:

- IL-4 or IL-13 -> Jak1/Jak3 -> STAT6
- CD40L (T cell) <> CD40 (B cell)

Mast cells also present CD40L + secret IL-4.

Dendritic cells, like Langerhan cells in skin, can "trap" antigens with nets of
surface IgE. eg. (*Fc\epsilonR1*)
