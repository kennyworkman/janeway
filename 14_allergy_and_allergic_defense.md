Allergy and Allergic Defense
===

Gell + Coombs classification system:

1. IgE (+ Mast cells)
2. Complement
3. Fc effector molecules
4. Various cellular effectors (lymphocytes + myeloid)

However, becoming more clear the 1/2/3 immune module system is a better
classifier of allergies.

Burden of allergy disease is actually sig. Lost time from school + work.

## IgE Allergies

*Immediate hypersensitivity reactions* - multivalent IgE bridging on surface of
mast + basophils.

Predisposition to IgE reaction is *atopy*

## Non-IgE Allergies

First exposure called sensitization.

- nasal passages (allergic rhinitis)
- eyes (*conjunctivitis*, refers to the conjunctiva)
- lower lungs + airways (asthma)
- gastrointestinal tract ()

Systemic reactions can spread from initial site:

- skin
- lungs (bronchospasms)
- vascular system

*atopic march* is the progression of reactions as someone ages

### Mechanisms of sensitization

1/ T_H2
2/ IgE class switching

1/ T_H2 differentiation

- DCs in mucosal tissue sample antigen and migrate to lymph tissue
- T_H2 cells induced by IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-13
- T_H2 cells produce IL-9/IL-13, positive feedback
- Mast cells + epithelial cells produce IL-33, also helping differentiation

In healthy individuals + absence of inflammation, T_regs induced by ,
controlling the response.

2/ T_H2 cause class switching:

- IL-4 or IL-13 -> Jak1/Jak3 -> STAT6
- CD40L (T cell) <> CD40 (B cell)

Mast cells also present CD40L + secret IL-4.

Dendritic cells, like Langerhan cells in skin, can "trap" antigens with nets of
surface IgE. eg. (*Fc\epsilonR1*)

### Antigens that cause sensitization

Actual numbers (small amounts):
- 1 ug of ragweed pollen allergen
- 20-75 ug bee venom

It is difficult to identify common characteristics of allergens.

Some are proteases:
*Der p 1*. Allergy in 20% of people. Cleaves occludin in epithelial junction
and access to subepithelial antigen presenting cells
*LEKT1*. (lymphoepithelial Kazal type-related inhibitor). Allergy diseases caused by mutations in protease inhibitors. *SPINK5* in *Netherton's syndrome*
- overactive _kallikrein_. Shedding of keratinocytes from cleaved desmosomes.
- overexpression of TSLP, TNF, ICAM
- LEKT1 also inhibits Staph. See colonization of skin with these bacteria in Netherton's syndrome patients

Transfer of 2S albumin from brazil nut into soybean caused allergic reaction
discontinuation of cell ag project

### Genetic predisposition

*Atopic triad*:
- allergic rhinoconjuctivitis
- allergic asthma
- allergic eczema

Asthma + eczema often linked. Although each individual allergy type has own
linked genes. Also ethnic differences.

#### Risk factors for general atopy

*11q12-13*

\beta subunit of Fc\epsilonRI

*5q31-33*

1/ IgE class switching, mast + eosinophil activation

IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-13

2/ TIM family

(T-cell, Immunoglobulin domain, Mucin domain) 
Associated with _airway hyperreacrtivity_, not only to specific allergens

Expressed by T_H1 + T_H2 cells
https://www.nature.com/articles/nri1111

3/ p40

Common subunit of IL-12 + IL-23

4/ \beta-andrenergic receptor

Smooth muscle contraction in airways

#### Risk factors for specific antigens

In contrast to above genes, which dysregulate immune response downstream of
arbitrary antigen, these are MHC allele variants for specific allergens

eg. HLA-B15:02 + peptide react to carbamazepine (seizure medication) leading to
rashes over the body that lead to scalding

#### Specific allergy disease mutations

- *fillagrin* (helps make "cornifying" keratinocytes tight) involved in eczema +
asthma. 7-10% of Caucasians have fillagrin mutation.
- metalloproteinase *ADAM33* in bronchial smooth muscle cells

### Environmental risk factors

Rural Africans show less atopy than American Africans.

*hygiene hypothesis* - exposure to pathogens early in childhood skews immune
development towards type 1 immune response from type 2.

However, negative correlation between atopy + helminth infections. Hygeine
hypothesis has evolved to include all three immune response types => trigger
*TGF-\beta + IL-10* -> 
* less differentiation of all three helper types and
* increased production T_reg 

Some pathogens help and others increase risk:

- RSV skews IFN-\gamma towards IL-4 (1->2) and increase asthma development
inkids

Diesel exhaust increases ROS, like ozone, increasing IgE production 20-50
fold
- dysfunction in genes that prevent oxidative stress (GSTP1, GSTM1) linked to
worse asthma
- inhibitors for eg. NADPH, might help asthma

### T_regs play important role

- T_regs isolated from atopic individuals when cocultured with T_H2 cells are
less effective a repressing cytokines
- Mice defficient in Foxp3 have greater risk for atopy

Treatments:

- IDO
- IL-35 / Il-27 cyotkine therapy, which inhibit T_H2
