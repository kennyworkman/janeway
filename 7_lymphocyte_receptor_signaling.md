Lymphocyte Receptor Signaling
===

## General principals of signal transduction and propogation

### 

### Multiprotein signaling complexes

Composition of multiple proteins is crucial for proper downstream signal
propogation.

SH2
- YXXZ

Scaffolds
Adapters

### Small G Proteins are molecular switches

Also called **small GTPase**

Include:
- Ras
- Rho
- Rac

Have two states - bound to GDP or GTP.

Role of following in "swtiching" G proteins:
- Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors (GNEFs)
- GTPase Activating Proteins (GAPs) are cofactors that

Mostly found in their inactive (GDP-bound) state

Localized to membrane by fatty acids attached post translationally

### Signaling proteins are recruited to the membrane in different ways

1. Phosphorylation of receptor itself or scaffold, followed by recognition by
SH2-domain containing signaling proteins or adaptors
2. Binding to small GTPases already bound to membrane by attached lipids
3. Recognition of locally phosphorylated membrane lipids

*phospholipid phosphatidylinositol* are phosphorylated by enzymes called
*phosphatidylinositol kinases* to produce PIP_2
and PIP_3 (2 and 3 phosphates on carbon rings). These enzymes are recruited by
its SH2 domain to phosphotyrosine on the tail of some receptor.

### Post translational protein modification can effect signal response

Phophate and ubiquitin additions to proteins can modulate constituents of
signal cascades.

Ubiquitin ligases (like Cbl) can be recruited by SH2 domains, so
tyrosine-phosphorylated targets can be modified by additional ubiquitin and
then targeted to degradation pathways.

## Antigen receptor signaling in lymphocytes

Antigen binding is not enough - signal needs to transduce to intracellular
components...
