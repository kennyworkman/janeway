# Humoral Immunity

Antibodies contribute to immunity through three key mechanisms:

- neutralization
- opinization
- complement activation

There are three main ideas here:

1. Affinity maturation + class switching are the core programs executed by
B-cells, facilitated by T-cells
2. Distribution and function of antibody types
3. How antibodies engage various effector functions

## B-cell activation by antigens + helper T-cells

### Activation of B-cells by antigen involves signals from the B-cell receptor

T_FH -> CD40L
CD40 -> B-cell marker

non-canonical NfKb -> main pathway for proliferation + differentiation ()


### Linked recognition of antigen by T-cells and B-cells promote anitgen

response

### B cells that encounter their antigens migrate towards the boundaries between B cell and T cell zones

It is remarkable that both these cells can be specific for the same type of
antigen when the odds are 1/10000.

#### Localization of cells is controlled by recptors and chemokines:

T-cells - CCR7 -> CCL19 + CCL21 expressed by stromal + dendritic cells in the
*T-cell zones*

B-cells - CXCR% -> CXCL13 expressed by specialized follicular dendritic cell in
the *primary lymphoid follicles* / *B-cell zones*.

B-cells encounter BAFF in the follicles, an important TNF-family cytokine that acts
through BAFF-R, but also BCMA + TACI, to activate the non-canonical NFkB
pathway similar to CD40.

Antigens are trapped by complement receptors on macrophages in specialized
zones (subcapsular sinus in lymph nodes + marginal sinus in spleen). These
macrophages do not swallow them for some reason. B cells shuttle between sinus
zones and follicle, bringing antigens to the FDCs there.

Movements:
- B-cells first position in the primary follicles for 6-24 hours with EBI2
expression.
- They then express CCR7 and move towards the interface of follicles + T-cell
zones where they encounter T-cells for crosslinking.

### T cells express surface molcules and cytokines that activate B-cells that in turn promote T_FH development

T-cells (early FH linaeage subtypes) express:

- IL-21 -> STAT3 activation in B-cell
- CD30L -> B-cell activation + proliferation 
- CD40L -> B-cell activation and proliferation

Prolong and stable physical contact mediated primarily by SLAM (IgG superfamily
protein expressed on both cells)

Some reciprocal signaling from B-cells - ICOSL binds to ICOS and leads to T_FH
differentiation. ICOS also involved in expressing Bcl-6 and c-Maf

### Activated B-cells differentiate into antibody secreting plasmablasts and plasma cells

2-3 days after initial activation, B-cells downregulate CCR7 and once again
express EBI2 to move into follicles. There they form clumps called the *primary
focus*.

The primary focus is mostly made up of plasmablasts. Not all T-cells become
plasmablasts in the primary focus and some become long-lived plasma cells.
These foci are pronounced 5 days into the infection but are temporary.

_Both types_ - Large volumes of antibody secretion. Up to 20% of protein
synthesized by cell. Continued expression of surface IG + MHC-II (though less
of both in plasma cells).

Then main difference seems to be plasmablasts continued ablity to class switch,
proliferate + (potentially) continued somatic hypermutation.

Plasma cells also seem to negatively supress T_FH cells by decreasing Bcl-6 and
IL-21 with cognate antigens on MHC-II.

### The 2nd phase of B-cell response occurs when B-cells migrate into primary follicles and form germinal centers


### *Summary*

- B cells become activated by both BCR and MHC:peptide recognition by helper
T-cells
- These cell types first 
- Major proteins:
    - CD40L -> CD40.
    - ICOS
    - IL-21
- T-cell activation in the germinal center induces proliferation and then
differentiation into either plasma cells or memory cells
- The "germinal center reaction" uses somatic hypermutation and class switching
to . Somatic hypermutation through AID is unique to B-cells.

## Distribution and function of immunoglobulin classes

Diffussion / transport is a key property of antibody constant chains that
determines their function. (Moving across organ barriers from site of
synthesis.)

### Antibodies of distinct classes operate in different places with different effector functions

### Polymeric immunoglobulin binds to the Fc regions of IgM and IgA and transports them across epithelial barriers

### The neonatal Fc receptor carries IgG agross the placenta and prevents excretion from the body

### High affinity IgG + IgA can neutralize toxins and block the infectivity of viruses + bacteria

### Antibody:antigen complexes activate the classic complement pathway by binding to C1q

### Complement and immune receptors contribute to the removal of immune complexes from circulation

## The distributions and functions of immunoglobulin classes

### Antibodies of different classes operate in distinct places

IgM are produced first

IgG is primary class in blood.
IgA is primary in secretions / epithelial tissue. Neutralizing over opinization. 

IgE binds avidly to mast cells, that release chemicals that cause vomiting,
sneezing and coughing.

### pIgR transport IgA and IgM across epithelial barriers

Generated right below epithelial layer and transported through epithelial cells
to surface (eg. the gut or bronchi).

- Synthesized in *lamina propria*
- Internalized by epithelial cells along basolateral surface (both basal + lateral)
- Passes through cytoplasm in a process called **transcytosis**
- Extracellular domain of pIgR + antibody is cleaved

Cleaved EC domain is called **Secretory Component**. 
- Bind to mucins in mucus (heavily glycosylated proteins)
- Protect antibodies from cleavage in gut

Where does this happen?
- Gut
- Respiratory epithelium
- Lactating Breast
- Other exocrine glands like tear + salivary

**Gut**

**Bronchi**

### neonatal Fc

### IgG / IgA neutralize toxins and block infectivity of viruses + bacteria

Toxins are effective at small concentrations. IgG need to diffuse rapidly and
bind with high avidity. Usually a toxic domain and a cell binding domain..

- Clostridium tetani. Blocks inhibitory neuron activiy and leads to chronic
contraction.
- Gas gangrene. Clostridium perfringens. Phospholipase
- Diphtheria. Corynebacterium diphtheria. Blocks protein synthesis
- Vibrio cholerae. cholera toxin. elevates cAMP and causes epithelial cells to
lose water
- Anthrax. Bacillus anthracis. 
- Botulism. Blocks release of acetylcholine, leading to paralysis. Clostridium botulinum
- Whooping cough. Bortedella pertussis. Pertussis toxin - 

### Antibody:antigen complexes activate classical complement pathway by binding C1q

Recall complement has:
- antibody dependent - **classical** pathway - C1q
- antibody independent - **lectin** pathway

The structure of C1q requires that antibodies are bound to the surface of a
cell and are not just floating around in serum.

Requires two or more Fc regions. One IgM molecule is enough. 2+ IgG needed. IgM
is more efficient at activating complement.

IgM shitfs from planar to staple conformation upon binding antigen and new
geometry is suitable for C1q binding.

### Complement + Fc receptors are involved in clearing immune complexes from circulation

- Fc receptors on phagocytes can clear complexes
- Erythrocytes can shuttle intact immune complexes to spleen and liver. There
they are cleared by phagocytes with both Fc + CR1 receptors. Saturation of
complex with complement proteins (C4b + C3b) seems to be involved in the
recognition + shuttling of the complex.

Complexes that are not cleared deposit on the basement membranes of blood
vessels, notably the glomerulus, where podocytes (the cells that filter blood)
have CR1 and are responsible in some capacity for filtering

### Summary

- IgM is the first isotype to express

## Destruction of antibody coated pathogens with Fc receptors

Effector cell recruitment mediated by different Fc receptors is important to
neutralize pathogens that are not already neutralized by binding - via
phagocytosis or release of cytokines.

Two main components:
- \alpha chain  - responsible for binding
- \gamma chain - responsible for signal transduction and transport to cell


### The Fc receptors

CD64 - IgG - macrophage / neutrophil / eosinophil
CD32 - IgG - MNE + B cell / mast cell (can be stimulatory or inhibitory depending on internal domain)
CD89 - IgA - macrophage / neutrophil / eosinophil

Some receptors that bear the same name (CD32) are inhibitory and other are not. 

Inhibitory Tyrosine associated Immune Motif

TRIM21 is a soluble Fc receptor in the cytoplasm with the highest affinity for
IgG. Responsible for clearing ingested complexes by E3 ligation.

### Fc receptors on phagocytes allow ingestion of pathogens

Some bacteria have capsular polysaccharide on membranes that prevent engulfment
and are only susceptible when coated by complement.

These are TI-2 antigens (do not require T-cell help, which includes affinity
maturation and memory B-cell). Induce secretion of IgM which recruit
compelemnt.

Because immune cell response is inflammatory want to avoid false positives.
Require multiple antibodies to be bound to pathogen to avoid this.

Fc receptors result in engulfment (acidic phagosome -> phygolysosome) or
release of toxic chemicals.

Macrophages and neutrophils mainly engulf - bacteria / virus.
Eosinophils mainly release chemicals - Helminth parasites / worms

### Fc receptors activate NK cells

Lymphoid lineage cells that have non-specific response:

- Recognize surface proteins directly
- Recognize antibodies bound to surface proteins. This has a name - ADCC.

### Mast cells bind IgE via very high affinity Fc\epsilon receptors

Fc\epsilon bind with very low concentrations and bind without the presence of
antigen. Most circulating IgE are already bound to mast cells in tissue and
circulating basophils

After crosslinking of surface-bound IgE by multivalent antigens, fast response:

- release cytokines
- release lipids eg. prostglandin (restrict airway, cause inflammation, recruit immune cells)
- histomines to increase vascular permeability

### IgE important for clearing parasites

Mast cells:

- recruit immune cells
- create blood flow to traffic antigens to lymph tissue
- muscle contraction expels antigens

Also involved in clearing parasites by clumping in the intenstine -
**mastocytosis**.

Eosinophils release granules and are responsible for killing many types of
parasites

## Summary

- Antibodies are produced by B lymphocytes and neutralize antigens in different
ways - binding, effector cells or complement.
- Antibody production requires a cognate T-cell with similar antigen
recognition. B-cells move to T-cell boundary for this.
- Class switching and somatic hypermutation occur in germinal centers.
- B-cells can become plasmablasts?
- T_H produce cytokines that help with class switching
