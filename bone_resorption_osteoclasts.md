How Osteoclasts Breakdown Bone
===

Osteoclasts are specialized, multinucleated cells that resorb (break down) bone
by creating a microenvironment that dissolves both the mineral and organic
components of bone. Here’s an explanation of the process along with an ASCII
diagram:

### The Process of Osteoclast-Mediated Bone Resorption

1. **Attachment and Sealing Zone Formation:**
   - Osteoclasts attach tightly to the bone surface using specialized adhesion molecules.
   - They form an actin-rich ring (the sealing zone) that creates an isolated microenvironment between the cell and the bone surface. This sealed-off area is called the **resorption lacuna**.

2. **Formation of the Ruffled Border:**
   - The part of the osteoclast membrane facing the bone becomes highly convoluted (ruffled). This increases the surface area and is the site where protons and enzymes are secreted into the lacuna.

3. **Acidification of the Resorption Lacuna:**
   - The osteoclast literally pumps H⁺ (protons) into the lacuna, acidifying the space. The low pH dissolves the mineralized component of bone (mainly hydroxyapatite, which contains calcium and phosphate).

Bone is made of a phosphate calcium lattice. H+ protonates the phosphate,
reducing their charge and causing ionic bonds to weaken, eventually falling
apart.

4. **Enzymatic Digestion of the Organic Matrix:**

   - Once the mineral is dissolved, enzymes like cathepsin K are secreted to
   break down the organic matrix (primarily collagen).

5. **Removal of Degradation Products:**

   - The degraded products (minerals, collagen fragments) are then endocytosed
   by the osteoclast and transported out of the cell for further processing and
   recycling.

         Down Bone Matrix:
         - Acid dissolves mineral (Ca²⁺, PO₄³⁻)
         - Enzymes (e.g., cathepsin K) digest collagen
```

### A bit on the chemistry

```
Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 + 14H⁺ → 10Ca²⁺ + 6H2PO4⁻ + 2H2O
```

Again, weakening the ionic bonds between phosphate and calcium ions.
Protonation of phosphate.

### Summary

- **Attachment & Sealing:** Osteoclasts form a tight attachment with the bone and isolate a resorption lacuna.
- **Ruffled Border Formation:** This specialized membrane area secretes acids and enzymes.
- **Acidification:** Protons acidify the lacuna to dissolve the mineral components.
- **Enzymatic Digestion:** Proteolytic enzymes degrade the organic matrix (collagen).
- **Removal:** Degradation products are taken up by the osteoclast for recycling.
