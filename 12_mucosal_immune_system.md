# Mucosal Immune System

Primitive organized lymph tissue and antibody producing cells first found in
gut of cartilaginous fish
Thymus and (bursa of Fabricus? avian) derive from embryonic gut.

## Structure

Most properties of mucosal systems are shared and gut is representative
example.

### What is it

75% of all lymphocytes

- gastrointestinal
- respiratory
- urogenital
- middle ear?
- glands:
    - conjuctivae (layer in front of eye)
    - lacrimal (weeping)
    - lactating breast

Distinct features:

- Diffuse lymph tissue and organized structures eg. Peyer's patches
- Specialized antigen uptake cells (M cells)
- Constant inflammatory state / active T cells
- Inhibitory macrophages + dendritic cells
- IgA

- celiaca (response to gluten)
- Chron's (response to commensal bacteria)

### Organization of lymph tissue

Diffuse and concentrated. Lamina propria + GALT

GALT:
- Peyer's patches
- isolated lymph follices 
- appendix
- palantine + lingual tonsil, adenoid

GALT + mesenteric lymph nodes make up organized lymph tissue

Peyer's patches (100-200 of them) are formed in the fetal gut. They are lymph
follices very rich in B-cells. The epithelial layer between them and gut has a
special Microfold cell (M-cell).

Thousands of isolated lymphoid follicles

Small intenstine tissue drain to *mesenteric lymph node* (largest in the body).

### How antigens are sampled in Peyer's patches

Recall M-cells lack mucus and many pathogens pass through them
(*transcytosis*). Dendritic cells + macrophages are waiting on the basal side. 
Why? CCL20/CCL9 binding to CCR6 + CCR1

1/ Transcytosis
2/ Lymphocyte sampling
3/ Migration from dome to T-cell area

### There are lots of active immune cells in the gut 

*Epithelial*:
- Inter-epithelial lymphocytes. Mostly CD8 T cells "slotted" in the lining.
- \alpha_E:\beta_7 (binds to E-selectin)

*Lamina propria*:
- Range of lymphocytes - CD4/CD8, plasma, macro, dendro, mast,
ILCs

Expressed in both. \alpha_4:\beta_7 -> binds to MadCAM on endothelium of blood vessels lining
mucosal tissues

### Homing

Recall CCL19 + CCL21 pull naive T-cells via CCR7
CXCL13 pull B-cells via CXCR5

CCL25 is specific for small intenstine
Likely similar for other components, but data unclear

Sometimes primed lymphocytes return to a very specific section of mucosal
system. Sometimes they do not, sharing immunity ("common mucosal immune
system").

### Dendritic cells

Two main types in Peyer's patches

CD11b+ - IL-23 ILC3
CD11b- - IL-12 ILC1

Also large circulation of dendritic cells from lamina propria to lymph (eg.
mesenteric) where they create effector T-cells. Under non-pathogenic
conditions, these effector T-cells regulate the immune response, mediated by
retinoic acid produced by D. cells (metabolized from vitamin A).

TGF-\beta produced by D. cells in intenstinal tissues also important for later
differentiation

Factors that promote anti-inflammatory behavior of DCs:
- TSL (thymic stromal lymphopoeiten)
- TGF\beta
- IL-10
- prostaglandin

### Gut macroophages

Highly phagocytotic but do not produce ROS, NOS, inflammatory cytokines. Mostly
because of *IL-10* that THEY produce constitutively. IL-10 also promotes
survival/differentiation of returning effector T-cells.

### Antigens don't just pass through M-cells

- Between gaps in normal epithelial cells
- Antibody coated pathogens uptake by FcRn (neonatal Fc R)
- Transepithelial dendrites / arms between cracks from macrophages

### IgA

3-4g of IgA secreted a day. ~75K present in normal intenstine at a time.

- Class switching exclusively in organized lymph tissue by T_FH cells, mediated
by TGF\beta
- Travel to lamina propria where differentiate into plasma cells.
- IgA travels into gut lumen by binding to pIgR (binds to J-chain
characteristic of "polymeric" immunoglobulin molecules)

How does it work?
- Inhibits binding to epithelium
- Neutralizes bacteria in lumen
- Can do the same within lamina and reexport to the gut

IgA defficiency is common (1 in 500 individuals) but not terrible because IgM
production ramps up / compensates.

### Weird Innate Cells

2/3% of lamina propria T-cells

MAIT
- recognize metabolites of vitamin B (riboflavin) presented on MR1 (MHC
analogue with specialized binding groove for small molecules)
- limited repertoire of \beta chains

iNKT ?

### Intenstinal epithelium is unique compartment

Single largest population of lymphocytes in the body. 90% are T-cells and 80%
are CD8.

- CCR9 + \alpha_E:\beta_7 (recall E-selectin)
- show restricted TCR clonality

There are two types:

a/ "inducible" - essentially normal cytotoxic T-cells

b/ "natural" - seem to kill epithelial cells and promote repair.
- express NKR that bind to MHC-like MICs that are expressed when epithelial
cells are stressed
- can express \gamma-\delta or \alpha\beta but have a CD8 \alpha\alpha
homodomier
- excess \gamma\delta IELs are associated with celiac disease
- unusual development. Likely escaped negative selection (autoreactivity)
despite having autoreactive TCRs. Likely due to homodimer CD8 binding less
tightly than the normal version.

## Response to infection

### Enteric pathogens cause local inflammation

Different receptors:

- TLRs on surface or with intercellular vesicles
- NOD
- NLR (NOD-like receptor)

Cause release of cytokines like IL-1/IL-6 and chemokines (eg. CCLC4-6)
Specialized cells:

- Paneth cells release antimicrobial peptides (ILC3/T_H17 module)
- Goblet cells

### Active immune system kicks in 

Dendritic cells release cytokines and help effector T-cells develop
- in Peyer's patches, they migrate to T-cell area
- in lamina propria, migrate to mesenteric lymph nodes

B-cells (producing IgA) proliferate in Peyer patch + mesenteric lymph follicles

homing adressins?

### T-cells preserve epithelial integrity


- CD8 kills epithelial cells to promote new cell growth from crypts
- IL-13 (ILC2) promotes turnover / shedding ("moving target")
- IL-22 (ILC3) promotes tight junctions

Peristaltic action (wave like muscle contraction of gut) that expels stuff

### Oral tolerance

Migration of dendritic T-cells producing retinoil acid + TGF-\beta
Expansion of Tregs that dampen immune response in the gut and systemically

eg. inability to generate Tregs or hyperactivity of T_H2 cells + IgE antibodies
leads to peanut allergies 

### Role of microbiome

- Essential in breaking down molecules needed by enterocytes:
- Mostly SCFAs like butyrate
- Also cellulose, vitamin K
- Surgical procedures that remove this population lead to necrosis +
inflammation of enterocytes due to lack of SCFA fuel
- Dysbiosis is the modulation of these populations

### Gut immune system control microbiota populations

- Dendritic cells that ingest and respond to these bacteria are "not fully
activated", preventing full deletion + maintaining some balance
- ~75% of gut microbes coated with IgA
- IL-10 produced by Tregs plays a role in preventing too much inflammation

### Gut microbes crucial for healthy immune system

Not just gut, systemically. Why?

Specific mechanisms of immune modulation by bacteria:

- Flagellin (eg. lactobacilli):
    - TLR activation leads to IL-6/IL-23 -> T_H17 differentiation
    - IgA production
- Clostridium:
    - Butyrate leads to IL-10 production (dampens inflammation)

### IBD + Chron's

- Combination of overactivity of immune cells + lack of suppressive factors
    - IL-23 is important - leading to T_H17 and sometimes T_H1
    - Linkage with polymorphism in IL-23 receptors
- Not linked to a specific species, but general pathology with bacterial
communities
