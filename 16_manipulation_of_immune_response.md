Manipulation of the Immune Response
===

Small pox 
Several classes of immune modulatory drugs

## Immune Drugs

The main goal of these drugs is to prevent unwanted tissue damage, towards
maintaining tissue function.

Conventional immunosuppresive drugs:

- corticosteroids (prednisone)
- cytotoxic (azathioprine)
- noncytotoxic but signal modulators (cyclosporin, rapamycin)
- cytokine receptor modulator

Precision proteins:

- mAbs
- fusion proteins (CTLA-4-Fc)

### Corticosteroids

Part of glucocorticoid family (`{mineralcorticoids, sex_steroids, glucocorticoid}`)

*prednisone* - a synthetic version of cortisol.

Activated intracellular receptors move into the nucleus where they control ~20%
of genes leukocytes express.

**Main mechanism:**

Expression of AnxaI - inhibitor of phosophlipase A2 (Arachidonic Acid).
Suppresses prostaglandin + leukotrienes.

Adverse effects:

- fluid retention (weak mineralocorticoid effects by upregulating sodium
transporters in kidney)
- weight gain (promote fat creation and stimulate appetite)
- diabetes (increase glucose generation in liver + decrease insulin sensitivity
in peripheral tissue)
- bone mineral loss (*osteoporosis* - bone cell proliferation, reduce calcium
absorption)
- thinning of skin (reduce collagen + ECM protein production)

### Cytotoxic drugs

These guys mostly interfere with DNA synthesis and originally created to treat
cancer. But found to suppress lymphocytes too.

High doses are only used to completely deplete lymphocyte populations eg. in
HSC transplants.

*azathioprine*:
- converted to purine analog 6-thioguanine (6-TG) and competes with purine metabolism
precursor to prevent A + G synthesis
- 6-TG can also directly incorporate itself into DNA where it increases risk of
mutation when exposed to UV
- Competes with GTP for GTPase Rac1 and inhibits CD28 costim. Inhibiting this
anti-apoptotic pathway leads to cell death.

*mycophenolate mofetil*:
- metabolized to mycophenolic acid: inhibits inosine monophosphate
dehydrogenase blocking GMP (guanine monophosphate)

*cyclophosphamide*:
- becomes _phosphoramide mustard_ and alkylates DNA with two "arms"
- part of nitrogen mustard family derived from mustard gas
- causes bladder hemorrhaging + inflammation

#### What is a mustard?

alkylating agents. Usually central nitrogen or sulfur with two alkylating
"arms".

Side effects come from general tissue toxicity. 

### Cyclosporin A, tacrolimus, rapamycin + JAK inhibitors interfere with signaling pathways

#### Calcineurin inhibitors

- cyclosporin A - Tolypocladium inflatum. Norway soil fungus. Binds to
*cyclophilins*.
- tacrolimus - Streptomyces tsukabaensis. Japan filamentous bacteria. binds to
*FK binding proteins*

Both bind to class of intracellular proteins called *immunophilins*. These
are isomerases, but unrelated to mechanism. Rather form a complex and inhibit
calcineurins.

Ca+ -> calmodulin -> calcneurin -> NFAT

Immunosuppresants of choice in clinic

#### mTOR inhibitor

- rapamycin - Streptomyces hygroscopicus. 'Rapa Nui' (polynesian name for
Easter Island). Origin of name.

Downstream of PI 3-kinase + Ras/MAPK

mTOR1 (rapamycin specific)
- proliferation
- autophagy (clears out damaged cell components, like mitochondria)

mTOR2
- actin cytoskeleton remodeling
- adhesion
- migration

Rapamycin:FKBP disrupts mTOR1

#### S1PR

Recognition of S1P by S1PR (actually a GCPR)
*Fingolimod* (2010) is a competitive binder

#### Jakinibs

Four members of JAK family: JAK1/2/3 + TYK2.

- Tofacitinib -> JAK3
- Ruxolitinib -> JAK1/2

### 

Non mAB:

- late 1800s equine sera for diptheria and tetanus
- *anti-lymphocyte globulin* (pooled from exposure to human lymphocytes in mice)
- *IVIG* (pooled from many human donors to provide wide repertoire)

The use as targeted tx agents for specific immune components is recent
development:
*1986 - muromomab (OKT3)*

Anti-CD52 mAB *alemtuzumab* now used.
Still use anti-lymphocyte globulin - sometimes broader depletion favorable,
cost and clinical familiarity

Broadly *depleting* and *non-depleting*.

### Humanization

Stem from the use of animal models to generate the antibodies

- *chimeric antibodies*: splicing human constant region into mouse variable region
- generating antibodies for genetically engineered mice with human genes
- fully human monoclonals from human hybridomas

#### Why is maintaing culture of antibody generating B cells difficult

- plasma cells (antibody generating B cells) isolated from donors are
terminally differentiated and short lived
- to induce long life, viral insertion of oncogenes OR fusion with cancer cells
directly is needed:
    - EBV transformation
    - hybridoma (fusion with myeloid)

omab - fully murine
ximab - *chimeric*: CDR + framework fused with human constant
zumab - *humanized*: only CDR spliced with human constant + framework
umab -  fully human

### Antibodies for allograft rejection

- *anti-CD52* _Alemtuzumab_ depletes T cells but still maintains some
graft-vs-leukemia effect (for unknown reasons)
- *anti-CD3*: _muromomab_ no longer used because of cytokine storm from reaction
with constant chain. _teplizumab_ has a two alanine substitution preventing
this.
- *anti-CD25*: subunit of IL-2. _daclizumab_ + _basiliximab_.
- *CTLA-4-Ig fusion*: _abatacept_ prevents costim (also approved for RA)

### Antibodies for autoimmune

#### Cytokines

TNF-\alpha:

mAB
- *infliximab*
- *adalimumab*

*etanercept*: TNF receptor subunit-Fc fusion

CD, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthropathy

IL-1

*ankira*: recombinant protein blocking IL-1 receptor
Muckle-Wells, RA

IL-6
*tocilizumab*

INF-\beta
Straight up cytokine: *Avonex*
How does it work?
- inhibits components of inflammasome (cleave Il-1 pro-protein)
- reduces expression of IL-1 pro-protein

#### Migration

integrin \alpha_4:\beta_1 (VLA-4) (binds to VCAM-1)

integrin \alpha_4:\beta_7 (binds to MAdCAM-1)

*natalizumab* specific for \alpha_4, inhibits both
CD, MS

But causes infection, including brain JC virus

#### Costims

CD28 (and B7 or CTLA-4)
*abatacept* - CTLA-4-Ig
RA, psoriasis

CD2 (CD58 or Lymphocyte Functioning Antigen, LFA-3)
*alefacept* - CD58-IgG1

#### Statins

- Inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, reducing liver cholesterol biosynthesis
-Somehow increases MHC-II expression on lymphocytes, likely due to lipid
concentration changes in cell membrane

#### Vitamin D_3

Bind to Vitamin D Receptors, which become TFs for a range of cytokines: IL-12
(DC), IL-2 + IFN-\gamma (CD4).

The doses needed cause hypercalcemia and bone resorption. Investaging
alternatives.

#### Using antigens

- Small amounts of allergens shift response from IgE to IgG/IgA

- Oral ingestion of antigens in mice has shifted CD4 autoimmmune response to
T_regs
- Limited success in people

Rather than oral ingestion:

- *Copaxone* contains 4 amino acids in ratios that mimic MBP (myelin basic
protein). It induces T_H2 response + reduces relapse by 30%
- "altered peptide ligands"

## Cancer

### IO developed after mouse models

*Congenic mice*: Identical except for single genetic region
Historically, MHC-congenic strains developed after induction of tumor.

*Syngeneic tumor* (genetically identical donor) always grow differently.
Introduction of irradiated tumor cells confer some immune response, specific to
tumor.
*Tumor rejection antigens*

### Mechanisms of tumor escape

- Paul Ehrlich, 1908 Noble Prize, first to suggest immune system kills cancer
- Frank Burnet + Lewis Thomas, 1960 NP, formulated 'immune surveillance':

Elimination -> Equilibrium -> Escape

Evidence:

- Mice: lacking perforin (lymphomas), lacking RAG + STAT1 (gut epithelial +
breast), lacking gamma/delta (skin cancer)
- Transplant: melonoma develop 1/2 years after kidney transplant,
*post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder* from unsuppressed EBV expansion

1/ Loss of antigen: mutations prevent expression of antigens in the first place
2/ Treated as self-antigen: antigens presented with lack of co-stims tolerize T cells
3/ Low immunogenicity: lose MHC expression, adhesion molecules, co0stims
4/ Immunosuppresive molecules: TGF-\beta (discovered in this context, hence
name), IL-10 (suppressive, eg. DC in gut), IDO (degrades tryptophan), PD-L1
5/ Physical barrier

*MDSC*s (Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells): pathologically activated immature
myeloid cells. Suppress different lymphocytes. Accumulate in TME.

### Classes of rejection antigens

- *Neoantigens*: Point mutations to existing binders/allow new proteins to bind to MHC
- *cancer-testis*: Usually expressed in male germ cells without MHC. Cancer can
start expressing them, eg. *MAGE* (melanoma-associated antigens). ex: NY-ESO-1
(New York esophageal squamous cell carcinoma-1)
- *tissue differentiation antigen*: eg. CD19 B cell
- *overexpression antigen*: HER-2/neu 
- *abnormal PTM*: underglycosylated mucin
- *skipped introns*: 
- *viral oncogenes*: HPV in cervical carcinoma

#### A look at melanoma specific antigens

- tyrosinase (melanin production pathway)
glycoproteins:
- gp100
- gp75
- MART1

Melanin is synthesized in special organelles called melanosomes and distributed
across keratinocytes.

#### Philadelphia chromosome

Piece of chrom 9 (ABL) breaks of and attaches to chrom 22 (BCR).

Bcr allows Abl (non receptor kinase) to bind to itself. Constitutively active
molecule leads to growth / proliferation and *Chronic Myeloid Leukemia*.

You can then identify reactive T-cells to Bcr-Abl using tetramers

#### Allografts

Expose donor lymphocyte infusion to leukemia specific peptides in-vivo for an
increased leukemia killing + potentially less graft-vs-host response.

### Structure of a CAR

ALL (acute lymphoid leukemia)

1/ CD19 
2/ 3 ITAMs from zeta chain of CD3
3/ 4-1BB (TNF)

*Can achieve complete clinical remissions with ALL!*

### mABs used against cancer antigens

- Competing with receptor ligand, preventing growth effect
- Recruiting immune response to large molecule bound to cell

*Herceptin* binding to *HER-2/neu* is a flagship example

Problems?

- Inefficient killing of cells after bound
- Hard to penetrate solid tumor
- Soluble antigens mopping up antibody

Different types of conjugation, either to mAB or just Fv fragment

- immunotoxins (usually a protein toxin): ricin A chain + Pseudomonas
- small molecule
- radioisotope

- ADEPT (antibody directed enzyme / pro drug therapy)

### Cancer Vaccines

- 2005 clinical trial: HPV vacccines 100% effective in preventing cervical
cancer
- Similar mechanism with liver cancer and hepatitis

### Checkpoint blockade

- Trying to get tumor to express costims like B7 doesn't seem to work that well
- CTLA-4. Expressed on activated conventional T cell + T_regs. Competes with
CD28 for B7 ligands. Ipilimumab
- PDL1. pembrolizumab.

## Vaccination

- variolation from corpse pustule in medical literature for 1000s of years
- Jenner - small pox vaccine. First to intentionally vaccinate with cowpox
(-vacca)?
- Pasteur, extended name in his honor with chicken cholera vaccine

Most vaccines happen to be good because they stimulate neutralizing antibodies.
But pathogens that require more complex response need better vaccines.

Specific examples:

1/ Malaria. Cycles between the liver and blood cells. Express different surface
proteins. Hide inside cells.
2/ Tuberculosis. Hides inside macrophages. Can be sequestered with granulomas
but create latent, living disease.
3/ HIV. Direct infection (and hiding) of T cell. High mutation. Latency.

### Attenuated or killed

- *attenuated*: reduced pathogenicity, eg. genetically modified that continues
into present for malaria (no vaccines currently)
- *killed*: vaccines can cause lethal responses, especially in immunosupressed 

"Reverse immunogenetics" to identify candidate peptide antigens that activate
innate sensors (eg. TLRs) as adjuvants

1/ Infections are insufficient to generate protective immunity:

- malaria
- tuberculosis
- HIV

2/ Cost, storage, deploying vaccines in developing countries difficult

### Most vaccines generate antibodies

1/ Neutralize exotoxin produced by pathogen. Diphtheria + tetanus.
2/ Neutralize pathogen itself to prevent re-infection.

- Because of linked recognition, pathogens must have epitopes recognized by
both T and B cells.

### Properties of effective vaccines

- Safe. Some can die from toxin or catch disease.
- Work in large proportion of population.
- Long lived. Must prime B + T cells.
- Cheap.

Herd immunity is possible but with large percentages of vaccinations.
For mumps, estimated to be @ 80%.

2004-2005 in UK saw uprise in mumps because MMR (mumps / measles / rubella) was
swapped with just MR because of supply.

### Measles / Mumps

Both *paramyxovirus* species
Enter from respiratory droplets into resp. tract.

Measles: 
1/ alveolar macrophages + dendritic cells -> lymph nodes -> T / B cells.
2/ *primary viremia* enters blood stream with T / B cells
3/ *secondary viremia* distributes to many organs

Mumps:
More localized to parotid glands.

### Live attenuated viral vaccines

Live viruses are more effective at recruiting active arms of immune system.
Attenuation can be achieved by selection for growth in non-human cells.
Pose risks to immunodeficient patients
Recombinant viruses offer path forward

### Live attenuated bacteria vaccines

Passaged BCG. Over 13 years + 200 passages to lose infectivity.

Malaria. Knockouts in sporozoites prevent transformation from liver to blood
infection.

### Route of ingestion matters

Injection is not only expensive and difficult at scale, it does not mimic
natural route of entry.

Example: live attenuated polio developed by Sabin. Vaccine can also spread like
normal virus in eg. fecal swimming pools.

Also, Proteins bind to epithelial cells and are resistant to proteases make good
adjuvants:
- E. coli derived heat-labile toxin (HBT). Ex: introduce with oral tetanus
toxin as adjuvant to build tolerance against lethal challenge.

Counter example: influenza.
Antibodies developed in mucus and systemically for upper and lower respiratory
respectively. Lower respiratory is what causes death. Oral ingestion would only
prevent mild illness from upper resp.

### Bordetella pertussis

Attenuated bacteria used to treat Whooping cough in early 1900s. 

In 1972, Japan, whooping cough cases increased because of fear of encephalitis
(brain swelling) pushed vaccination age from 3 months to 2 years.

Lead to development of acellular vaccine: single protein component isolated +
purified. More effective and without side effects.

### Conjugate vaccines

T cell independent (TI) antigens stimulate B cells without T cell help.

Capsular polysaccharides (eg. meningococcus, pneumococcus) are such TI antigens
and can be used on their own with adults.

However young children (<2) cannot mount TI response:
immature marginal zone B cells (the cells that handle TI), signaling pathways
maturing.

Cross link protein to carrier protein recognized by T cell.

### Adjuvants

- Adjuvant approved in specific vaccine use
- Alum (aluminum salt) is the only adjuvant approved.
- MF59 (oil-in-water emulsion)

Trigger TLRs, NOD-like receptors, NLRP3

### DNA vaccines

Stable and safe, but weak response. Encoding cytokines helps.

Trasnfecting directly in dendritic cells allows efficient presentation. Trials
underway.

### Vaccines can be used for existing chronic infections

1/ Obvious immune response but fails to eliminate
- Helminth
- Tuberculosis
2/ Pathogen is "hiding"
- HIV
- herpes
