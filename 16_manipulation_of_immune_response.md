Manipulation of the Immune Response
===

Small pox 
Several classes of immune modulatory drugs

## Immune Drugs

The main goal of these drugs is to prevent unwanted tissue damage, towards
maintaining tissue function.

Conventional immunosuppresive drugs:

- corticosteroids (prednisone)
- cytotoxic (azathioprine)
- noncytotoxic but signal modulators (cyclosporin, rapamycin)
- cytokine receptor modulator

Precision proteins:

- mAbs
- fusion proteins (CTLA-4-Fc)

### Corticosteroids

Part of glucocorticoid family (`{mineralcorticoids, sex_steroids, glucocorticoid}`)

*prednisone* - a synthetic version of cortisol.

Activated intracellular receptors move into the nucleus where they control ~20%
of genes leukocytes express.

**Main mechanism:**

Expression of AnxaI - inhibitor of phosophlipase A2 (Arachidonic Acid).
Suppresses prostaglandin + leukotrienes.

Adverse effects:

- fluid retention (weak mineralocorticoid effects by upregulating sodium
transporters in kidney)
- weight gain (promote fat creation and stimulate appetite)
- diabetes (increase glucose generation in liver + decrease insulin sensitivity
in peripheral tissue)
- bone mineral loss (*osteoporosis* - bone cell proliferation, reduce calcium
absorption)
- thinning of skin (reduce collagen + ECM protein production)

### Cytotoxic drugs

These guys mostly interfere with DNA synthesis and originally created to treat
cancer. But found to suppress lymphocytes too.

High doses are only used to completely deplete lymphocyte populations eg. in
HSC transplants.

*azathioprine*:
- converted to purine analog 6-thioguanine (6-TG) and competes with purine metabolism
precursor to prevent A + G synthesis
- 6-TG can also directly incorporate itself into DNA where it increases risk of
mutation when exposed to UV
- Competes with GTP for GTPase Rac1 and inhibits CD28 costim. Inhibiting this
anti-apoptotic pathway leads to cell death.

*mycophenolate mofetil*:
- metabolized to mycophenolic acid: inhibits inosine monophosphate
dehydrogenase blocking GMP (guanine monophosphate)

*cyclophosphamide*:
- becomes _phosphoramide mustard_ and alkylates DNA with two "arms"
- part of nitrogen mustard family derived from mustard gas
- causes bladder hemorrhaging + inflammation

#### What is a mustard?

alkylating agents. Usually central nitrogen or sulfur with two alkylating
"arms".

Side effects come from general tissue toxicity. 

### Cyclosporin A, tacrolimus, rapamycin + JAK inhibitors interfere with signaling pathways

#### Calcineurin inhibitors

- cyclosporin A - Tolypocladium inflatum. Norway soil fungus. Binds to
*cyclophilins*.
- tacrolimus - Streptomyces tsukabaensis. Japan filamentous bacteria. binds to
*FK binding proteins*

Both bind to class of intracellular proteins called *immunophilins*. These
are isomerases, but unrelated to mechanism. Rather form a complex and inhibit
calcineurins.

Ca+ -> calmodulin -> calcneurin -> NFAT

Immunosuppresants of choice in clinic

#### mTOR inhibitor

- rapamycin - Streptomyces hygroscopicus. 'Rapa Nui' (polynesian name for
Easter Island). Origin of name.

Downstream of PI 3-kinase + Ras/MAPK

mTOR1 (rapamycin specific)
- proliferation
- autophagy (clears out damaged cell components, like mitochondria)

mTOR2
- actin cytoskeleton remodeling
- adhesion
- migration

Rapamycin:FKBP disrupts mTOR1

#### S1PR

Recognition of S1P by S1PR (actually a GCPR)
*Fingolimod* (2010) is a competitive binder

#### Jakinibs

Four members of JAK family: JAK1/2/3 + TYK2.

- Tofacitinib -> JAK3
- Ruxolitinib -> JAK1/2

### 

Non mAB:

- late 1800s equine sera for diptheria and tetanus
- *anti-lymphocyte globulin* (pooled from exposure to human lymphocytes in mice)
- *IVIG* (pooled from many human donors to provide wide repertoire)

The use as targeted tx agents for specific immune components is recent
development:
*1986 - muromomab (OKT3)*

Anti-CD52 mAB *alemtuzumab* now used.
Still use anti-lymphocyte globulin - sometimes broader depletion favorable,
cost and clinical familiarity

Broadly *depleting* and *non-depleting*.

### Humanization

Stem from the use of animal models to generate the antibodies

- *chimeric antibodies*: splicing human constant region into mouse variable region
- generating antibodies for genetically engineered mice with human genes
- fully human monoclonals from human hybridomas

#### Why is maintaing culture of antibody generating B cells difficult

- plasma cells (antibody generating B cells) isolated from donors are
terminally differentiated and short lived
- to induce long life, viral insertion of oncogenes OR fusion with cancer cells
directly is needed:
    - EBV transformation
    - hybridoma (fusion with myeloid)

omab - fully murine
ximab - *chimeric*: CDR + framework fused with human constant
zumab - *humanized*: only CDR spliced with human constant + framework
umab -  fully human

### Antibodies for allograft rejection

- *anti-CD52* _Alemtuzumab_ depletes T cells but still maintains some
graft-vs-leukemia effect (for unknown reasons)
- *anti-CD3*: _muromomab_ no longer used because of cytokine storm from reaction
with constant chain. _teplizumab_ has a two alanine substitution preventing
this.
- *anti-CD25*: subunit of IL-2. _daclizumab_ + _basiliximab_.
- *CTLA-4-Ig fusion*: _abatacept_ prevents costim (also approved for RA)
