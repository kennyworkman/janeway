Manipulation of the Immune Response
===

Small pox 
Several classes of immune modulatory drugs

## Immune Drugs

The main goal of these drugs is to prevent unwanted tissue damage, towards
maintaining tissue function.

Conventional immunosuppresive drugs:

- corticosteroids (prednisone)
- cytotoxic (azathioprine)
- noncytotoxic but signal modulators (cyclosporin, rapamycin)
- cytokine receptor modulator

Precision proteins:

- mAbs
- fusion proteins (CTLA-4-Fc)

### Corticosteroids

Part of glucocorticoid family (`{mineralcorticoids, sex_steroids, glucocorticoid}`)

*prednisone* - a synthetic version of cortisol.

Activated intracellular receptors move into the nucleus where they control ~20%
of genes leukocytes express

Main mechanism:

expression of AnxaI - inhibitor of phosophlipase A2 (Arachidonic Acid).
Suppresses prostaglandin + leukotrienes.

Adverse effects:

- fluid retention (weak mineralocorticoid effects by upregulating sodium
transporters in kidney)
- weight gain (promote fat creation and stimulate appetite)
- diabetes (increase glucose generation in liver + decrease insulin sensitivity
in peripheral tissue)
- bone mineral loss (*osteoporosis* - bone cell proliferation, reduce calcium
absorption)
- thinning of skin (reduce collagen + ECM protein production)

### Cytotoxic drugs

These guys mostly interfere with DNA synthesis and originally created to treat
cancer. But found to suppress lymphocytes too.

High doses are only used to completely deplete lymphocyte populations eg. in
HSC transplants.

*azathioprine* - 
*cyclophosphamide* - 
*mycophenolate* - 

Side effects come from general tissue toxicity.
