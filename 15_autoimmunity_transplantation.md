Autoimmunity and Transplantation
===

Allergies are hyper immune response to foreign antigen.

Here we focus on immune reactions to self, bacteria and transplants.

## Mechanics of self-tolerance

We try to screen out self-reactive lymphocytes during development but:

- some weak interacting ones also respond to foreign antigens, so we need them
- some just escape

### Review of tolerance

Paul Ehrlich discovered / described autoimmunity in early 20th century. Named
"horror autotoxicus".

Autoimmune conditions are actually on the rise + comprise ~5% of population.

How does immune system identify "self" in the first place?

Central tolerance: 
- broadly inactivation due to strong binding signals in thymus

Peripheral tolerance
- Antigens presented from normal cell turnover
- Not associated with cytokines or costim expression
- Either the activated T cell does nothing or T_regs induced

### More complete list of tolerance mechansims

- *Anergy* (peripheral inactivation by signaling without inflammation or costims)
- *Central tolerance* (deletion by negative selection)
- *T_regs* (iT_reg/nT_reg, suppression in antigen or nonspecific way)
- *functional deviation* direct differentiation into T_reg 

We have some amount of autoreactive lymphocytes in the first place. Why?

- positive selection requires loose binding to understand if MHC works
- constant stimulation in periphery from loose interaction to keep cells alive

### Central tolerance

Thymus epithelial cells and CD8\alpha+ DCs express antigen genes from elsewhere
in the body (like insulin).

AIRE (autoimmune regulator) TF seems to cause this.

*APECED* -> disease of pancreas autoimmunity from deffective
(Autoimmune Polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystroophy)

- *interaction with TLR* - unmethylated CpG can be internalized by B cells and
  interact with internal TLRs
- autoantibodies against DNA, chromatin + ribo
- *antigen amount* - release of cardiac antigen following heart attack leads to immune response days
  later
- *antigen structure* - IgG can crosslink B cells when it forms immune complexes 

### Priveleged sites

Brain, eye, testis, uterus

How do these sites reduce immune activity?

- tissue barriers prevent lymphocytes from entering
- TGF-\beta induces T_reg differentiation
- Fas ligand 

Sites source of autoimmune disease (MS): T cells activated elsewhere.
*Sympathetic Ophthalmia*: trauma to one eye creates antigens that active T
cells outside and allow them to come in (they are able to get through barrier
somehow)

### Autoimmune disease controlled by specific T cell types

different diseases depend on different T cell types
*type 1 diabetes mellitus* - T_H1
*psoriasis* - T_H17

immune modulation

### Involvement of T_regs

nT_reg - express FoxP3. Respond to self antigens specifically.
iT_reg - develop in periphery in response to TGF-\beta. Not antigen specific.

Oral tolerance to antigen primarily caused by iT_reg generation

- Normal levels of defective T_reg present in MS patients
- Foxp3 negative (but IL-10 positive)

## Autoimmune disease

Often involve multiple components of system.

### Specific antigens cause disease

Antigen + adjuvant injected into animal elicits disease.  But models are not
faithful because we generally don't know how autoimmunity starts

Organ specific:

*Hashimoto's thyroiditis*
*Grave's disease*

Systemic:

*SLE*
*Sjogren's syndrome*

Commensal:

*IBD* - Chron's + UC

### Involve different components of immune system

- autoantibodies block receptors
- immune complexes deposit + cause tissue damage
- effector T cells cause inflammation + tissue damage

Antibody mediated disease can be transferred to newborns across placenta.
Some can cause tissue damange before successful clearance of blood plasma with
_plasmapheresis_.

#### Autoimmune disease with strong antibody component

Myasthenia gravis - acetylcholine receptor
Graves' - TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) receptor
Thrombocytopenic purpura - platelets

#### Autoimmune disease mix all components of immune system

Examples. T cell mediated disease, like SLE + MS involve B cells (present
antigen to T cell) and antibodies (generally around).

Antibody mediated disease involve T/B cell through antibody development
(secretion + cross linking).

### How do you get chronic disease?

Initial response to antigen straightforward enough.

Removal of the antigen in normal immunity usually causes effector cells to die
off. In autoimmunity, either because of quantity or ubiquity, antigen always
around.

How does the immune response amplify?:

- Big component is the breakdown of "sequestration" by intial tissue damage.
- More epitopes on same antigen are recognized (*epitope spreading*):
    - Hidden components (present in low concentrations) are efficiently presented
      by B cells
    - Additional molecules recruited with original epitope are internalized
      accidentally by B cells

Examples of epitope spreading:

- *SLE* - B cell internalizes large DNA complex. Activates T cells for differnt
  pieces - histone pieces, ribosomal protein
- *Pemphigus vulgaris* - binds to desmosomes and causes dissolution of skin
  tissue. Starts with harmless Dsg-3 antibodies but spreading eventually
  creates the kind causing deep skin blistering.

### Autoimmune disease organized by response type

Like allergies, we first thought grouped by degree of active/inactive 
Becoming clear that similar to allergy re-classification - most of the immune
components are involved in each response.

However we still classify based on *antigen* and *main mechanism*.

Classified based on antigen and main mechanism 

- Type 2 responses play almost no role in autoimmunity, exclusively
  atopy/allergy

### Autoantibodies kill blood cells

- Auto IgG and IgM bind to Fc and CR

- Rapidly cleared by *mononuclear-macrophage phagocytic system* in spleen
- or lysed by membrane attack complex of complement
- Autoantibodies against surface proteins (eg. autoimmune thrombocytopenic
  purpura)

- Nucleated blood cell lysis is less common but still happens

Tx strategies:
- _Removal of the spleen_ to prevent macrophage clearance is a common tx strategy
- Also introduction of lots of nonspecific IgG (IVIG) - intravenous
  immunoglobulin.

### Fixation of complement

- Can directly lyse cells
- Sublytic doses also causes problems:
- cytokine release
- respiratory burst
- arachidonic acid cleavage

*C5a itself is a chemokine*

#### Nucleated cells are more resistant to complement lysis

Why?

In general, unnucleated cells lack metabolic machinery (mitochondria + nucleus) to make new proteins.

1/ Complement regulating surface proteins
CD55 - DAF (decay-accelerating factor), accelerates C3 convertase decay
CD59 - protectin (), binds c8/c9 components of membrane attack complex (MAC)

2/ Can repair some membrane damange caused by MAC

### Autoantibodies block receptors

Examples of either:

Agonist (*Grave's disease*). Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) from pituitary
is controlled by thyroid hormone. Autoantibodies directly stimulate thyroid
receptor and prevent negative feedback.

Antagonist (*myasthenia gravis*). Muscle contraction inhibited by autoantibody
inhibition of nicotinic acetylcholine.

### Autoantibodies cause damage in ECM

- Goodpasture's syndrome - type IV (basement membrane) collagen in renal
glomeruli and pulmonary alveoli

Immune complexes:
- serum sickness (overwhlemed by immune complex)
- bacterial endocarditis (lodged in cardiac valve, unable to kill source)
- *mixed essential cryoglobulinemia*
- SLE

SLE main steps:

1/ Autoantibodies against proteins in nucleated cells 
(
3 types: 
- nucleosome subunits of chromatin
- spliceosome
- ribonucleoprotein complex
)
2/ Complexes traffic to renal glomerular basement membrane
3/ Poor clearance (due to dysfunction of complement *proteins* and lack of
opsonization)

*Cryoglobulins*, soluble antibodies because of hydrophobic regions or clumping,
that precipitate in joints/tissue.

### T cells in autoimmunity

Hard to study because adoptive transfer in people require MHC matching

Culture requires the exact tissue from patient presenting problematic antigen

#### MS

Multiple sclerosis is a response against nervous system myelin angitens:

- myelin basic protein MBP
- proteolipid protein PLP
- myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein MOG

These live on oligodendrocytes (support glial cell that maintain myelin
sheath).

1/ Initial antigen stimulus
2/ BBB is "opened up". Epithelial cells lose tight junctures in response to
inflammation and express adhesion molecules
3/ Rolling and entering (diapedesis)
4/ Re-encounter antigen

The plaques come from combination of demylenation and astrocyte proliferation /
ECM production.
