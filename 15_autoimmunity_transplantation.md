Autoimmunity and Transplantation
===

Allergies are hyper immune response to foreign antigen.

Here we focus on immune reactions to self, bacteria and transplants.

## Mechanics of self-tolerance

We try to screen out self-reactive lymphocytes during development but:

- some weak interacting ones also respond to foreign antigens, so we need them
- some just escape

### Review of tolerance

Paul Ehrlich discovered / described autoimmunity in early 20th century as
"horror autotoxicus".

Autoimmune conditions are actually on the rise.

Central tolerance
Peripheral tolerance
