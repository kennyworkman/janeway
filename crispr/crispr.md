triply edited with cd27

* less of targets

* homogoneous edits
* some PE do better with templates with lots of secondary structure, 

tldr; engineer pes to perform better at different types of edits

## Regulatory Spacers - Shmakov

* cas express in mini-array with spacer that is complementary to upstream promoter
* self regulation of expression

Arrays in CRISPR systems are repeat sequences that flank spacers.

A mini-array is an array with only two repeat sequencs (thus one spacer).

These mini arrays encode spacers that are often complementary to the promoter
of the mini array itself, inducing a self-regulatory systsem

## Polymerase Editors - Erik Sontheimer

Split PE prevents self annealing

Natural RT are bad (M-MLV RT):

* *Fidelity* - does not correct in the antisense direction
* dNTP incoporation rate (naturally limited to dividing cells?)
* *Processivity* - length of reverse transcription event

so use DNA Polymerase

## R Loops - Kevin Aris

negative supercoiling - R loop formation
positive supercoiling - R loop dissocation

What are motiffs that cause natural supercoiling

PKCS9 in non human primates paper

GALNAC - LNP was not to target specific cells but because patients they were
treating lack LNP receptors (because of the genetic underpinnings of high LNP)

what did FDA care about with IND package

- general off-targets
- editing of germline cells
