Lipoproteins
===

Allows transport of water insoluble fats through blood plasma.

### Structure

Outer shell
- Apolipoprotein
- Phospholipids

The number and type of apolipoproteins determine the function of the lipoprotein.

Inner (hydrophobic) core:
- triglycerides
- cholesterol

### Classes

Categorized by density

- Chylomicrons (ULDL) transport dietary fats from intestines throughout the body
- VLDL are assembled from triglycerides in the liver and go to adipose tissue
- IDL
- LDL (correlate with atherosclerosis progression)
- HDL collect fat and transport back to liver ("good")

### Metabolism

#### Exogenous

Breakdown of dietary fats. Involves mainly chylomicrons:

- Triglycerides assemble with apolipoprotein B to form precursor chylomicrons
- Precursor chylomicrons move through lymph duct directly into bloodstream
- Precursor chylomicrons receive APOC and APOE and become mature
- Mature chylomicrons release in interaction with lipoprotein lipase
- Hydrolysis of triglycerides releases fatty acids and glycerol
- Chylomicron remnants interact (with APOE) with receptors in liver where the
are degraded and used for energy

#### Endogenous

- Nascent VLDL are assembled in hepatocytes with APOB
- Nascent VLDL receive APOE and APOC from HDL and become mature
- Mature VLDL release free fatty acids and glycerol from LPL (lipoprotein lipase)
- Remnant VLDLs are called IDL
- IDL can be hydrolyzed once more to create LDL

**Interaction with innate immune system** - some fraction of LDLs interact with
scavenger receptors on macrophages and are ingested via phagocytosis.
Cholesterol laden macrophages become foam cells, die and deposit as
atherosclerotic plaques.

#### Reverse Transport

- HDL assembled in liver
- HDL collect cholesterol in different tissues and deposit elsewhere

### Health Notes

High levels of lipoproteins can lead to abnormal hardening of the blood
vessels, called atherosclerosis.
