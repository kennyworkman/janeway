# Induced Response of Innate Immunity

* How do phagocytes detect and destroy pathogens
* Downstream inflammatory pathways

ILCs (Innate Lymphoid Cells):
    * NK Cells

### Macrophages 

Come from:

- Progenitor cells in various tissues that produce macrophages throughout life of organism
- Monocytes circulate freely throughout blood or crawl endothelium

Two molcules act on the same receptor to stimulate macrophage proliferation:

- Interleukin 34 (IL-34)
- Macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF)

Two types of monocytes.

"Classic" monocytes    
    - 90% 
    - Express CD14, a coreceptor for PRR
    - Circulate freely in blood

"Patrolling" monocytes
    - Express CD14 and CD16 (Fc receptor)
    - Crawl along endothelium

### Granulocytes

- Neutrophil
- Eosinophil
- Basophil

### Dendritic Cells

Produce type I interferons

### Phagocytosis

Phagosome fuses with lysosome to form phagolysosome.

Some chemistry terminology:

* A radical is an atom, molecule, ion that has at least one unpaired valence electron
* Red(uction)Ox(idation) reactions are thsoe that transfer electrons between species
* Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) are 
* Superoxide ( (O_2)- ) is an example of an ROS
* Nitric Oxide is an example of a radical

Nitric oxide and superoxide are produced in the phagolysosome to neutralize
microbes.

### Phagocytic Receptors

Carbohydrate binding:
* Dectin 1
* Mannose Receptor

Scavenger receptors: 
* Some bind to low density lipoproteins (see notes on "foam cells" [here](./lipoproteins) 
* 

Complement receptor
Fc receptor (constant domain of antibody chain)

### G Protein Coupled Receptors

fMet-Leu-Phe (fMLF) Receptor and C5 Receptor both guide macrophage / neutrophil to
source of infection (towards high concentration of stimulating ligand) 

Protein synthesis is initiated with fMet in prokaryotes and not eukaryotes.
*fMLF* binds to this amino acid(?)

*C5 Receptor* binds to cleaved C5 from complement pathway.


#### GPCR Mechanism

GPCR is distinct from G Protein, which is a three subunit protein consisting of \alpha, \beta, \gamma subunits.

#### Respiratory Burst

Rapid consumption of oxygen by NADPH to produce ROS is called *respiratory burst*

Activating the fMLF or complement receptor (the same receptors that encourage migration towards sites of infection) produces NADPH oxidase (phagocyte oxidase)

Reactive Oxidative Species (ROS) kill microbes in phagocytic or extracellular environments

#### Chronic Granulomatous Disease

Genetic defficiency of NADPH cause release of less reactive oxygen species. Those with CGD are more prone to bacterial/fungal diseases.

### Inflammation

Cytokines + chemokines facilitate inflammation.

Four kinds of modification to blood vessels:

- Vessels dialate
- Endothelial cells express adhesion factors to trap circulating leukocytes
- Endothelial cells become permissive and blood flows into tissue
- Clotting
