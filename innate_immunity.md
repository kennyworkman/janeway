# Induced Response of Innate Immunity

Innate immunity consist of (molecular) pattern recognition receptors:
- free receptors in serum (ficolins and histatins (complement))
- membrane bound phagocytic
- membrane bound signaling
- cytoplasmic signaling

## Phagocytes are a diverse family of cells that kill microbes

### Many phagocytic cells

*Macrophages* come from:

- Progenitor cells that enter various tissues _in the fetal state_ and produce macrophages throughout life of organism (!)
- Monocytes circulate freely throughout blood or crawl endothelium

Found in especially large numbers in connective tissues: gastrointenstinal
submucosal layer, lungs (bronchi, alveoli), spleen (where they remove senescent
cells).

Examples include *microglial cells* in neurons and *Kupffer cells* in the
liver, stimulated by IL-34 in both.

*Monocytes* come in two forms:

"Classic" monocytes, that differentiate into active monocytes and macrophages,
circulating freely in blood. They make up **90%** and express CD14 only.

"Patrolling" monocytes that "crawl" along endothelium. They express both CD14
and CD16. Do not differentiate.

*Granulocytes* include:

- Neutrophil
- Eosinophil
- Basophil

*Dendritic cells*:

- cDCs (classical) digest and expose microbes as antigen material for the
adaptive immune system (the bridge between active and innate immunity)
- pDCs (plasmacytoid) produce type I interferon

### Phagocytosis

Phagosome fuses with lysosome to form phagolysosome.

Some chemistry terminology:

* A radical is an atom, molecule, ion that has at least one unpaired valence electron
* Red(uction)Ox(idation) reactions are thsoe that transfer electrons between species
* Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) are:
    * Superoxide ( (O_2)- )
    * Nitric Oxide is an example of a radical

Nitric oxide and superoxide are produced in the phagolysosome to neutralize
microbes.

### Phagocytic Receptors

* C-type lectin-like receptors (eg. Dectin 1)
* Mannose Receptor (now believed to clear endogenous carbs that are released during inflammation)
* Scavenger receptors (Some bind to low density lipoproteins (see notes on "foam cells" [here](./lipoproteins))
* Complement / Fc receptors (connection to complement system and active immune system respectively)

### G-Protein-Coupled Receptors

Class of ancient receptors that stimulate intercellular killing.

* fMet-Leu-Phe (fMLF) receptor (fMet initiates peptides in bacteria)
* C5a receptor (cleaved C5 molecule from activated complement system)

The receptor has 7 membrane spanning regions and *associate* with (do not
"have") G-proteins - heterotrimeric units.  When a ligand binds to the
receptor, it swaps a GDP with a GTP, and the G-protein splits into alpha and
beta-gamma blocks.

These subunits interact with *Rho family GTPase proteins*, Rac and Rho, that
activate microbicidal behavior. These induce, among other things, the
production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS).

*NADPH oxidase*, also called phagocytic oxidase, produces superoxide (O_2-)
when fully assembled, but requires recruitment of cytosolic components to
membrane components. The cell then can use NADPH oxidase in a process called
respiratory burst, to consume lots of oxygen and produce ROS. Neutrophils using
lots of respiratory burst die and create pus.

Genetic defficiency of NADPH cause release of less reactive oxygen species.
Those with CGD are more prone to bacterial/fungal diseases.

Neutrophils can also release their nuclear chromatin as web like traps called
NETs (nuetrophil extracellular trap) to immobolize microbes for phagocytosis
(!).

### Inflammation

Cytokines + chemokines facilitate inflammation.

Four kinds of modification to blood vessels:

- Vessels dialate
- Endothelial cells express adhesion factors to trap circulating leukocytes. (Leukocyte migration is called *extravasation*)
- *Endothelial activation* - Endothelial cells become permissive and blood flows into tissue (edema)
- Clotting

What causes these inflammatory responses? Few things:

- Lipid mediators of inflammation (prostaglandins, leukotrienes, PAF) produced
by degraded membranes
- chemokines + cytokines eg. TNF-alpha
- C5a from complement

If there is wounding, the *kinin cascade* and *coagulation cascade* are also
spun up that regulate blood pressure, pain, coagulation.

## Toll-like receptors

Broad class of PRR (pattern recognition receptors)

Toll was a receptor initially discovered to control dorso-ventral (front-back) patterning in
fruit fly embryo. It was later discovered by Jules Hoffman that the same
receptors released antimicrobial peptiedes.

Important PAMPs:

- lipoteichoic acid (gram positive)
- lipoprotein (gram negative)
- flagellin
- unmethylated DNA

### TLR Structure

Each TLR has 20-25 Leucine Rich Repeats (LRR) that form a convex hook.
They sometimes form dimers with eachother.

Binding a ligand causes TLR to dimerize or causes a conformation change with a
preformed dimer.

All mamallian TLRs have an interleukin receptor in their tail. (Not really sure
the role of this. Assume its involved in sigaling cascade)

#### TLR 1 / 2 / 6

Among other ligands recognized are:
- lipoteichoic acid (gram negative)
- Triacyl + diacyl lipoprotein (gram negative)

These guys dimerize (1 <> 2; 2 <> 6)

#### TLR 5

Bind to a conserved (intact) flaggelin domain that is deep within flagella

#### TLR 11 / 12

Bind to whole proteins (many unknown) from protozoans and microbes. Expressed
in mice.

#### TLR 10

Ligand unknown. Expressed in humans
