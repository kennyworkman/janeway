# Integration of innate and adaptive immunity

## The distinct phases of infection

innate sensor cells:

- epithelial
- tissue resident mast
- dendritic
- macrophage

- obligate intracellular
- facultative intracellular

- focus of infection

  ---
  luminal

  basal
  ---

All three of these layers are called the mucosal layer:

- epithelial
- laminal propria {house immune cells}
- smooth muscle

Present in organ systems respiratory, digestive, urogenital.

Epithelial activation -> innate cells traffic through post-capillary venules ->
inflammation from cells leads to more cells + leaky epithelial cells provide
complement

general, non-specific cytokine response (eg. TNF)
specific cytokine distribution from sensor cells dependent on molecular pattern
of pathogen

ILCs:
- recruit monocytes and granulocytes
- differentiate specific T-cell effector types

Innate immune system keeps pathogen under control until the active has time to
step in

### Different effector "compartments" for different pathogens

ILCs, effector T, B -> myelomonocytes

myelomonocytes:

- neutrophils
- monocytes
- eosinophils
- basophils

### ILC1

_Intracellular pathogens_

*IL-12 / IL-18*

_ ILC1 respond to IL-12 / IL-18. Mostly produced by macrophages.
- NK cells are grouped with ILC1. Considered innate and part of this
intermediate response?

*IFN-\gamma*

_ IgG
_ Macrophages, respond to IFN-\gamma, for cell killing
_ T_H1, respond to IFN-\gamma

### ILC2

TSLP and IL-33/IL-25

_multi-cellular / Helminth parasites_

- ILC2

*IL-5*
- goblet cells in epithelium to produce mucus

- IgE

*IL-13*
- Eosinophils, basophils, mast

Unclear how ILC2 recruit T_H2, but likely through IL-4 produced by eosinophil
et. al
- T_H2


### ILC3

IL-23
IL-1\beta

Activate ILC3, releasing IL-17/IL-22, with following effect on environment:

IL-17, pro-inflammatory, releasing further IL-1\beta, IL-6
IL-22, induces antimicrobrial peptides

## Effector T-cells

### Changes in adhesion molecule and chemokine receptor expression

T_FH:
- up CXCR5 (home to follicles / B-cell zones)
- down CCR7 (directs T-cells to T-cell zones)
- down S1PR1

Other effectors:
- up S1PR1
- down CCR7

sphingosine 1-phosphate

S1PR1 -> sphingosine 1-phosphate
CCR7

L-selectin
glycosylated -> PSLG-1
