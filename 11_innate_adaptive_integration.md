# Integration of innate and adaptive immunity

## The distinct phases of infection

innate sensor cells:

- epithelial
- tissue resident mast
- dendritic
- macrophage

- obligate intracellular
- facultative intracellular

- focus of infection

  ---
  luminal

  basal
  ---

All three of these layers are called the mucosal layer:

- epithelial
- laminal propria {house immune cells}
- smooth muscle

Present in organ systems respiratory, digestive, urogenital.

Epithelial activation -> innate cells traffic through post-capillary venules ->
inflammation from cells leads to more cells + leaky epithelial cells provide
complement

general, non-specific cytokine response (eg. TNF)
specific cytokine distribution from sensor cells dependent on molecular pattern
of pathogen

ILCs:
- recruit monocytes and granulocytes
- differentiate specific T-cell effector types
